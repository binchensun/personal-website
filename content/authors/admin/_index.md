Dr. Bin Chen is an Associate Professor in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.njit.edu/) and the [Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research](https://centers.njit.edu/cstr/) at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/). His research focuses on solar flares and coronal mass ejections, the largest explosions in the solar system that can affect our Earth and near-Earth environment, known as Space Weather. He develops novel radio observing techniques to study physical processes underlying the flare energy release include magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration. He utilize observations from state-of-the-art radio telescopes, including [Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array](http://ovsa.njit.edu/), [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and [Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), and multiple NASA space telescopes including [SDO](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [RHESSI](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/), [Hinode](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hinode/mission.html), and [Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu). 


He was the recipient of the [National Science Foundation CAREER Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_CAREER_Awards) in 2017, and the [NASA/UCAR Jack Eddy Fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/heliophysics/jack-eddy) in 2013. He is currently serving as a Committee Member of the [Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society](https://spd.aas.org/). At NJIT, he serves as the Director of the [Applied Physics Graduate Program](https://physics.njit.edu/academics/graduate). His work is funded by NSF and NASA.

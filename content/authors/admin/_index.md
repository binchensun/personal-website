Bin Chen is an Associate Professor in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.njit.edu/) and the [Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research](https://centers.njit.edu/cstr/)[ ](https://centers.njit.edu/cstr/)at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/). Prior to NJIT, I worked as an Astrophysicist at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). 

He was the recipient of the [National Science Foundation CAREER Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_CAREER_Awards) in 2017, and the [NASA/UCAR Jack Eddy Fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/heliophysics/jack-eddy) in 2013. He is currently serving as a Committee Member of the [Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society](https://spd.aas.org/).  

[Research in Dr. Chen's group](https://bchensun.wixsite.com/home/research) focuses on solar flares and coronal mass ejections, the largest explosions in the solar system that can affect our Earth and near-Earth environment, known as Space Weather. We utilize observations from state-of-the-art radio telescopes, including [Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array](http://ovsa.njit.edu/), [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and [Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), and multiple NASA space telescopes including [SDO](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [RHESSI](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/), [Hinode](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hinode/mission.html). Research funded by NSF and NASA.

<!--Dr. Bin Chen is an Associate Professor in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.njit.edu/) and the [Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research](https://centers.njit.edu/cstr/) at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/). His research focuses on solar flares and coronal mass ejections, the largest explosions in the solar system that can affect our Earth and near-Earth environment, known as Space Weather. He develops novel radio observing techniques to study physical processes underlying the flare energy release include magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration. He utilize observations from state-of-the-art radio telescopes, including [Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array](http://ovsa.njit.edu/), [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and [Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), and multiple NASA space telescopes including [SDO](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [RHESSI](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/), [Hinode](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hinode/mission.html), and [Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu).-->

Dr. Bin Chen is an Associate Professor of Physics at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/). Research in his group focuses on solar flares and coronal mass ejections, the largest explosions in the solar system that can affect our Earth and near-Earth environment, known as Space Weather. He develops novel radio observing techniques and utilizes multi-wavelength observations to study physical processes underlying these catastrophic energy release events. He co-leads the NJIT solar radio group (with [Prof. Dale Gary](https://web.njit.edu/~gary/)), which operates the [Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array](http://ovsa.njit.edu/).

He was the recipient of the [National Science Foundation CAREER Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_CAREER_Awards) in 2017, and the [NASA/UCAR Jack Eddy Fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/heliophysics/jack-eddy) in 2013. He served as a Committee Member of the [Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society](https://spd.aas.org/) (2019–2021). He is currently serving on the [Solar & Heliophere Panel of the ongoing NASEM 2024-2033 Solar & Space Physics Decadal Survey](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/decadal-survey-for-solar-and-space-physics-heliophysics-2024-2033-panel-on-the-physics-of-the-sun-and-heliosphere). At NJIT, he serves as the Director of the [Applied Physics Graduate Program](https://physics.njit.edu/academics/graduate) (2020–present). His work receives funding from NSF and NASA.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We have a new study [published in Nature Astronomy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02122-6). The study, led by Dr. Sijie Yu of our group, presents aurora-like radio bursts above a Sunspot with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The results may have profound implications on the interpretation of similar bursts observed on other stars.

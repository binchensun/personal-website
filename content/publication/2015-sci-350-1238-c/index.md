abstract: Solar flares—the most powerful explosions in the solar system—are also efficient
  particle accelerators, capable of energizing a large number of charged particles
  to relativistic speeds. A termination shock is often invoked in the standard model
  of solar flares as a possible driver for particle acceleration, yet its existence
  and role have remained controversial. We present observations of a solar flare termination
  shock and trace its morphology and dynamics using high-cadence radio imaging spectroscopy.
  We show that a disruption of the shock coincides with an abrupt reduction of the
  energetic electron population. The observed properties of the shock are well reproduced
  by simulations. These results strongly suggest that a termination shock is responsible,
  at least in part, for accelerating energetic electrons in solar flares.

abstract: The middle corona, the region roughly spanning heliocentric distances from
  1.5 to 6 solar radii, encompasses almost all of the influential physical transitions
  and processes that govern the behavior of coronal outflow into the heliosphere.
  The solar wind, eruptions, and flows pass through the region, and they are shaped
  by it. Importantly, the region also modulates inflow from above that can drive dynamic
  changes at lower heights in the inner corona. Consequently, the middle corona is
  essential for comprehensively connecting the corona to the heliosphere and for developing
  corresponding global models. Nonetheless, because it is challenging to observe,
  the region has been poorly studied by both major solar remote-sensing and in-situ
  missions and instruments, extending back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
  (SOHO) era. Thanks to recent advances in instrumentation, observational processing
  techniques, and a realization of the importance of the region, interest in the middle
  corona has increased. Although the region cannot be intrinsically separated from
  other regions of the solar atmosphere, there has emerged a need to define the region
  in terms of its location and extension in the solar atmosphere, its composition,
  the physical transitions that it covers, and the underlying physics believed to
  shape the region. This article aims to define the middle corona, its physical characteristics,
  and give an overview of the processes that occur there.

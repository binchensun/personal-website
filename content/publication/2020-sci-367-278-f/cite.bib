 abstract = {Solar flares are powered by a rapid release of energy in the solar
corona, thought to be produced by the decay of the coronal
magnetic field strength. Direct quantitative measurements of the
evolving magnetic field strength are required to test this. We
report microwave observations of a solar flare, showing spatial
and temporal changes in the coronal magnetic field. The field
decays at a rate of åisebox-0.5ex~5 Gauss per
second for 2 minutes, as measured within a flare subvolume of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^28$ cubic centimeters.
This fast rate of decay implies a sufficiently strong electric
field to account for the particle acceleration that produces the
microwave emission. The decrease in stored magnetic energy is
enough to power the solar flare, including the associated
eruption, particle acceleration, and plasma heating.},

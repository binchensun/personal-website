abstract: An observation from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph reveals coherent
  oscillations in the loops of an M1.6 flare on 2015 March 12. Both the intensity
  and Doppler shift of Fe xxi 1354.08 ̊A show clear oscillations with a period of
  ~25 s. Remarkably similar oscillations were also detected in the soft X-ray flux
  recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). With
  an estimated phase speed of ~2420 km s$^-1$ and a derived electron density of at
  least 5.4 × 10$^10$ cm$^-3$, the observed short-period oscillation is most likely
  the global fast sausage mode of a hot flare loop. We find a phase shift of ~ensuremathπ/2
  (1/4 period) between the Doppler shift oscillation and the intensity/GOES oscillations,
  which is consistent with a recent forward modeling study of the sausage mode. The
  observed oscillation requires a density contrast between the flare loop and coronal
  background of a factor ensuremath≥42. The estimated phase speed of the global mode
  provides a lower limit of the Alfvén speed outside the flare loop. We also find
  an increase of the oscillation period, which might be caused by the separation of
  the loop footpoints with time.

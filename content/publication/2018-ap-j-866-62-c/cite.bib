 abstract = {Magnetic reconnection, the central engine that powers explosive
phenomena throughout the universe, is also perceived to be one
of the principal mechanisms for accelerating particles to high
energies. Although various signatures of magnetic reconnection
have been frequently reported, observational evidence that links
particle acceleration directly to the reconnection site has been
rare, especially for space plasma environments currently
inaccessible to in situ measurements. Here we utilize broadband
radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy available from the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array to observe decimetric type III radio
bursts in a solar jet with high angular (~20″),
spectral (~1%), and temporal resolution (50
ms). These observations allow us to derive detailed trajectories
of semirelativistic (tens of keV) electron beams in the low
solar corona with unprecedentedly high angular precision
($łt$0.″65). We found that each group of electron beams, which
corresponds to a cluster of type III bursts with 1-2 s duration,
diverges from an extremely compact region (~600
km$^2$) in the low solar corona. The beam-diverging sites are
located behind the erupting jet spire and above the closed
arcades, coinciding with the presumed location of magnetic
reconnection in the jet eruption picture supported by extreme
ultraviolet/X-ray data and magnetic modeling. We interpret each
beam-diverging site as a reconnection null point where
multitudes of magnetic flux tubes join and reconnect. Our data
suggest that the null points likely consist of a high level of
density inhomogeneities possibly down to 10 km scales. These
results, at least in the present case, strongly favor a
reconnection-driven electron-acceleration scenario.},

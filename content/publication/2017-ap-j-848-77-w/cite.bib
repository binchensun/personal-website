 abstract = {Fiber bursts are a type of fine structure that is often superposed on
type IV radio continuum emission during solar flares. Although
studied for many decades, its physical exciter, emission
mechanism, and association with the flare energy release remain
unclear, partly due to the lack of simultaneous imaging
observations. We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging
observations of decimetric fiber bursts, which occurred during
the rise phase of a long-duration eruptive flare on 2012 March
3, as obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 1-2
GHz. Our results show that the fiber sources are located near
and above one footpoint of the flare loops. The fiber source and
the background continuum source are found to be co-spatial and
share the same morphology. It is likely that they are associated
with nonthermal electrons trapped in the converging magnetic
fields near the footpoint, as supported by a persistent coronal
hard X-ray source present during the flare rise phase. We
analyze three groups of fiber bursts in detail with dynamic
imaging spectroscopy and obtain their mean frequency-dependent
centroid trajectories in projection. By using a barometric
density model and magnetic field based on a potential field
extrapolation, we further reconstruct the 3D source trajectories
of fiber bursts, for comparison with expectations from the
whistler wave model and two MHD-based models. We conclude that
the observed fiber burst properties are consistent with an
exciter moving at the propagation velocity expected for whistler
waves, or models that posit similar exciter velocities.},

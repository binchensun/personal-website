 abstract = {We analyze the spectra of high-temperature Fe XXIV lines observed by the
Hinode/Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) during the
impulsive phase of the X8.3-class flare on 2017 September 10.
The line profiles are broad, show pronounced wings, and clearly
depart from a single-Gaussian shape. The lines can be well
fitted with \ensuremathąppa distributions, with values of
\ensuremath\p̨pa varying between \ensuremath≈1.7
and 3. The regions where we observe the non-Gaussian profiles
coincide with the location of high-energy
(\ensuremath≈100-300 keV) hard X-ray (HXR) sources
observed by RHESSI, suggesting the presence of particle
acceleration or turbulence, also confirmed by the observations
of nonthermal microwave sources with the Expanded Owens Valley
Solar Array at and above the HXR loop-top source. We also
investigate the effect of taking into account
\ensuremath\kp̨a distributions in the temperature
diagnostics based on the ratio of the Fe XXIII
\ensuremathłambda263.76 and Fe XXIV
\ensuremathłambda255.1 EIS lines. We found that these lines
can be formed at much higher temperatures than expected (up to
log(T[K]) \ensuremath≈ 7.8) if departures from
Maxwellian distributions are taken into account. Although larger
line widths are expected because of these higher formation
temperatures, the observed line widths still imply nonthermal
broadening in excess of 200 km s$^-1$. The nonthermal
broadening related to HXR emission is better interpreted by
turbulence than by chromospheric evaporation.},

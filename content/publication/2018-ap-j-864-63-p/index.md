abstract: We analyze the spectra of high-temperature Fe XXIV lines observed by the
  Hinode/Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) during the impulsive phase
  of the X8.3-class flare on 2017 September 10. The line profiles are broad, show
  pronounced wings, and clearly depart from a single-Gaussian shape. The lines can
  be well fitted with kappa distributions, with values of kappa
  varying between ~1.7 and 3. The regions where we observe the non-Gaussian
  profiles coincide with the location of high-energy (ensuremath≈100-300 keV) hard
  X-ray (HXR) sources observed by RHESSI, suggesting the presence of particle acceleration
  or turbulence, also confirmed by the observations of nonthermal microwave sources
  with the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array at and above the HXR loop-top source.
  We also investigate the effect of taking into account ensuremathkp̨a distributions
  in the temperature diagnostics based on the ratio of the Fe XXIII 263.76
  and Fe XXIV 255.1 EIS lines. We found that these lines can be formed
  at much higher temperatures than expected (up to log(T[K]) ~ 7.8) if departures
  from Maxwellian distributions are taken into account. Although larger line widths
  are expected because of these higher formation temperatures, the observed line widths
  still imply nonthermal broadening in excess of 200 km s$^-1$. The nonthermal broadening
  related to HXR emission is better interpreted by turbulence than by chromospheric
  evaporation.

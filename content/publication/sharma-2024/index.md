abstract: The accelerated electrons during solar flares produce radio bursts and nonthermal
  X-ray signatures. The quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) and fine structures in spatial–spectral–temporal
  space in radio bursts depend on the emission mechanism and the local conditions,
  such as magnetic fields, electron density, and pitch-angle distribution. Radio burst
  observations with high-frequency time resolution imaging provide excellent diagnostics.
  In converging magnetic field geometries, the radio bursts can be produced via the
  electron cyclotron maser (ECM). Recently, using observations made by the Karl G.
  Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1–2 GHz, Yu et al. reported a discovery of long-lasting
  auroral-like radio bursts persistent over a sunspot and interpreted them as ECM-generated
  emission. Here we investigate the detailed second and subsecond temporal variability
  of this continuous ECM source. We study the association of 5 s period QPPs with
  a concurrent GOES C1.5-class flare, utilizing VLA's imaging spectroscopy capability
  with an extremely high temporal resolution (50 ms). We use the density and magnetic
  field extrapolation model to constrain the ECM emission to the second harmonic O-mode.
  Using the delay of QPPs from X-ray emission times, combined with X-ray spectroscopy
  and magnetic extrapolation, we constrain the energies and pitch angles of the ECM-emitting
  electrons to ≈4–8 keV and textgreater26°. Our analysis shows that the loss-cone
  diffusion continuously fuels the ECM via Coulomb collisions and magnetic turbulence
  between a length scale of 5 and 100 Mm. We conclude that the QPP occurs via the
  Lotka–Volterra system, where the electrons from solar flares saturate the continuously
  operating ECM and cause temporary oscillations.

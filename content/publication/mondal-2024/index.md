abstract: The standard flare model, despite its success, is limited in comprehensively
  explaining the various processes involving nonthermal particles. One such missing
  ingredient is a detailed understanding of the various processes involved during
  the transport of accelerated electrons from their site of acceleration to different
  parts of the flare region. Here we use simultaneous radio and X-ray observations
  from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging
  X-rays on board the Solar Orbiter, respectively, from two distinct viewing perspectives,
  to study the electron transport processes. Through detailed spectral modeling of
  the coronal source using radio data and footpoint sources using X-ray spectra, we
  compare the nonthermal electron distribution at the coronal and footpoint sources.
  We find that the flux of the nonthermal electrons precipitated at the footpoint
  is an order of magnitude greater than that trapped in the looptop, consistent with
  earlier works that primarily used X-ray for their studies. In addition, we find
  that the electron spectral indices obtained from X-ray footpoints are significantly
  softer than the spectral hardness of the nonthermal electron distribution in the
  corona. We interpret these differences based on transport effects and the difference
  in sensitivity of microwave and X-ray observations to different regimes of electron
  energies. Such an understanding is crucial for leveraging different diagnostic methods
  of nonthermal electrons simultaneously to achieve a more comprehensive understanding
  of the electron acceleration and transport processes of solar flares.

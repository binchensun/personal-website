abstract: Nonthermal electrons accelerated in solar flares produce electromagnetic
  emission in two distinct, highly complementary domains---hard X-rays (HXRs) and
  microwaves (MWs). This paper reports MW imaging spectroscopy observations from the
  Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array of an M1.2 flare that occurred on 2017 September
  9, from which we deduce evolving coronal parameter maps. We analyze these data jointly
  with the complementary Reuven Ramaty High- Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager HXR
  data to reveal the spatially-resolved evolution of the nonthermal electrons in the
  flaring volume. We find that the high-energy portion of the nonthermal electron
  distribution, responsible for the MW emission, displays a much more prominent evolution
  (in the form of strong spectral hardening) than the low-energy portion, responsible
  for the HXR emission. We show that the revealed trends are consistent with a single
  electron population evolving according to a simplified trap-plus-precipitation model
  with sustained injection/acceleration of nonthermal electrons, which produces a
  double-powerlaw with steadily increasing break energy.

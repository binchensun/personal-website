 abstract = {The first self-consistent simulations of electron acceleration during
magnetic reconnection in a macroscale system are presented.
Consistent with solar flare observations, the spectra of
energetic electrons take the form of power laws that extend more
than two decades in energy. The drive mechanism for these
nonthermal electrons is Fermi reflection in growing and merging
magnetic flux ropes. A strong guide field suppresses the
production of nonthermal electrons by weakening the Fermi drive
mechanism. For a weak guide field the total energy content of
nonthermal electrons dominates that of the hot thermal electrons
even though their number density remains small. Our results are
benchmarked with the hard x-ray, radio, and extreme ultraviolet
observations of the X8.2-class solar flare on September 10,
2017.},

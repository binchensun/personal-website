abstract: By direct measurements of the gas temperature, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) has yielded a new diagnostic tool to study the solar chromosphere.
  Here, we present an overview of the brightness-temperature fluctuations from several
  high-quality and high-temporal-resolution (i.e. 1 and 2 s cadence) time series of
  images obtained during the first 2 years of solar observations with ALMA, in Band
  3 and Band 6, centred at around 3 mm (100 GHz) and 1.25 mm (239 GHz), respectively.
  The various datasets represent solar regions with different levels of magnetic flux.
  We perform fast Fourier and Lomb-Scargle transforms to measure both the spatial
  structuring of dominant frequencies and the average global frequency distributions
  of the oscillations (i.e. averaged over the entire field of view). We find that
  the observed frequencies significantly vary from one dataset to another, which is
  discussed in terms of the solar regions captured by the observations (i.e. linked
  to their underlying magnetic topology). While the presence of enhanced power within
  the frequency range 3-5 mHz is found for the most magnetically quiescent datasets,
  lower frequencies dominate when there is significant influence from strong underlying
  magnetic field concentrations (present inside and/or in the immediate vicinity of
  the observed field of view). We discuss here a number of reasons which could possibly
  contribute to the power suppression at around 5.5 mHz in the ALMA observations.
  However, it remains unclear how other chromospheric diagnostics (with an exception
  of Hensuremathα line-core intensity) are unaffected by similar effects, i.e. they
  show very pronounced 3-min oscillations dominating the dynamics of the chromosphere,
  whereas only a very small fraction of all the pixels in the 10 ALMA datasets analysed
  here show peak power near 5.5 mHz. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting
  issue `High-resolution wave dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere'.

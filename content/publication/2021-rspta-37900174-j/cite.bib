 abstract = {By direct measurements of the gas temperature, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has yielded a new
diagnostic tool to study the solar chromosphere. Here, we
present an overview of the brightness-temperature fluctuations
from several high-quality and high-temporal-resolution (i.e. 1
and 2 s cadence) time series of images obtained during the first
2 years of solar observations with ALMA, in Band 3 and Band 6,
centred at around 3 mm (100 GHz) and 1.25 mm (239 GHz),
respectively. The various datasets represent solar regions with
different levels of magnetic flux. We perform fast Fourier and
Lomb-Scargle transforms to measure both the spatial structuring
of dominant frequencies and the average global frequency
distributions of the oscillations (i.e. averaged over the entire
field of view). We find that the observed frequencies
significantly vary from one dataset to another, which is
discussed in terms of the solar regions captured by the
observations (i.e. linked to their underlying magnetic
topology). While the presence of enhanced power within the
frequency range 3-5 mHz is found for the most magnetically
quiescent datasets, lower frequencies dominate when there is
significant influence from strong underlying magnetic field
concentrations (present inside and/or in the immediate vicinity
of the observed field of view). We discuss here a number of
reasons which could possibly contribute to the power suppression
at around 5.5 mHz in the ALMA observations. However, it remains
unclear how other chromospheric diagnostics (with an exception
of H\ensuremathα line-core intensity) are unaffected by
similar effects, i.e. they show very pronounced 3-min
oscillations dominating the dynamics of the chromosphere,
whereas only a very small fraction of all the pixels in the 10
ALMA datasets analysed here show peak power near 5.5 mHz.

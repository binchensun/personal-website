abstract: Auroral radio emissions in planetary magnetospheres typically feature highly
  polarized, intense radio bursts, usually attributed to electron cyclotron maser
  emission from energetic electrons in the planetary polar region that features a
  converging magnetic field. Similar bursts have been observed in magnetically active
  low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, often prompting analogous interpretations. Here
  we report observations of long-lasting solar radio bursts with high brightness temperature,
  wide bandwidth and high circular polarization fraction akin to these auroral and
  exo-auroral radio emissions, albeit two to three orders of magnitude weaker than
  those on certain low-mass stars. Spatially, spectrally and temporally resolved analysis
  suggests that the source is located above a sunspot where a strong, converging magnetic
  field is present. The source morphology and frequency dispersion are consistent
  with electron cyclotron maser emission due to precipitating energetic electrons
  produced by recurring nearby flares. Our findings offer new insights into the origin
  of such intense solar radio bursts and may provide an alternative explanation for
  aurora-like radio emissions on other flare stars with large starspots.

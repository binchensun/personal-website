abstract: We report the detection of emission from a nonthermal electron distribution
  in a small solar microflare (GOES class A5.7) observed by the Nuclear Spectroscopic
  Telescope Array, with supporting observation by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
  Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The flaring plasma is well accounted for by a thick-target
  model of accelerated electrons collisionally thermalizing within the loop, akin
  to the ``coronal thick-target'' behavior occasionally observed in larger flares.
  This is the first positive detection of nonthermal hard X-rays from the Sun using
  a direct imager (as opposed to indirectly imaging instruments). The accelerated
  electron distribution has a spectral index of 6.3 ensuremath± 0.7, extends down
  to at least 6.5 keV, and deposits energy at a rate of ensuremath∼2 × 10$^27$ erg
  s$^-1$, heating the flare loop to at least 10 MK. The existence of dominant nonthermal
  emission in X-rays down to <5 keV means that RHESSI emission is almost entirely
  nonthermal, contrary to what is usually assumed in RHESSI spectroscopy. The ratio
  of nonthermal to thermal energies is similar to that of large flares, in contrast
  to what has been found in previous studies of small RHESSI flares. We suggest that
  a coronal thick target may be a common property of many small microflares based
  on the average electron energy and collisional mean free path. Future observations
  of this kind will enable understanding of how flare particle acceleration changes
  across energy scales, and will aid the push toward the observational regime of nanoflares,
  which are a possible source of significant coronal heating.

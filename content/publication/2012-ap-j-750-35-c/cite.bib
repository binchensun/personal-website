 abstract = {Coronal hard X-ray (HXR) and continuum \ensuremathγ-ray sources
associated with the impulsive phase of solar flares have been
the subject of renewed interest in recent years. They have been
interpreted in terms of thin-target, non-thermal bremsstrahlung
emission. This interpretation has led to rather extreme physical
requirements in some cases. For example, in one case,
essentially all of the electrons in the source must be
accelerated to non-thermal energies to account for the coronal
HXR source. In other cases, the extremely hard photon spectra of
the coronal continuum \ensuremathγ-ray emission suggest
that the low-energy cutoff of the electron energy distribution
lies in the MeV energy range. Here, we consider the role of
inverse Compton scattering (ICS) as an alternate emission
mechanism in both the ultra- and mildly relativistic regimes. It
is known that relativistic electrons are produced during
powerful flares; these are capable of upscattering soft
photospheric photons to HXR and \ensuremathγ-ray
energies. Previously overlooked is the fact that mildly
relativistic electrons, generally produced in much greater
numbers in flares of all sizes, can upscatter extreme-
ultraviolet/soft X-ray photons to HXR energies. We also explore
ICS on anisotropic electron distributions and show that the
resulting emission can be significantly enhanced over an
isotropic electron distribution for favorable viewing
geometries. We briefly review results from bremsstrahlung
emission and reconsider circumstances under which non-thermal
bremsstrahlung or ICS would be favored. Finally, we consider a
selection of coronal HXR and \ensuremathγ-ray events
and find that in some cases the ICS is a viable alternative
emission mechanism.},

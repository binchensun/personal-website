abstract: Understanding the dynamics of the quiet solar corona is important for answering
  key questions including the coronal heating problem. Multiple studies have suggested
  small-scale magnetic-reconnection events may play a crucial role. These reconnection
  events are expected to involve acceleration of electrons to suprathermal energies,
  which can then produce nonthermal observational signatures. However, due to the
  paucity of sensitive high-fidelity observations capable of probing these nonthermal
  signatures, most studies were unable to quantify their nonthermal nature. Here we
  use joint radio observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Expanded Owens
  Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) to detect transient emissions from the quiet solar corona
  in the microwave (GHz) domain. While similar transients have been reported in the
  past, their nonthermal nature could not be adequately quantified due to the unavailability
  of broadband observations. Using a much larger bandwidth available now with the
  VLA and EOVSA, in this study, we are able to quantify the nonthermal energy associated
  with two of these transients. We find that the total nonthermal energy associated
  with some of these transients can be comparable to or even larger than the total
  thermal energy of a nanoflare, which underpins the importance of nonthermal energy
  in the total coronal energy budget.

abstract: "The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope\
  \ has commenced science observations of the Sun starting in late 2016. Since the\
  \ Sun is much larger than the field of view of individual ALMA dishes, the ALMA\
  \ interferometer is unable to measure the background level of solar emission when\
  \ observing the solar disk. The absolute temperature scale is a critical measurement\
  \ for much of ALMA solar science, including the understanding of energy transfer\
  \ through the solar atmosphere, the properties of prominences, and the study of\
  \ shock heating in the chromosphere. In order to provide an absolute temperature\
  \ scale, ALMA solar observing will take advantage of the remarkable fast-scanning\
  \ capabilities of the ALMA 12 m dishes to make single-dish maps of the full Sun.\
  \ This article reports on the results of an extensive commissioning effort to optimize\
  \ the mapping procedure, and it describes the nature of the resulting data. Amplitude\
  \ calibration is discussed in detail: a path that uses the two loads in the ALMA\
  \ calibration system as well as sky measurements is described and applied to commissioning\
  \ data. Inspection of a large number of single-dish datasets shows significant variation\
  \ in the resulting temperatures, and based on the temperature distributions, we\
  \ derive quiet-Sun values at disk center of 7300 K at ensuremathłambda = 3 mm and\
  \ 5900 K at ensuremathłambda = 1.3 mm. These values have statistical uncertainties\
  \ of about 100 K, but systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale that may\
  \ be significantly larger. Example images are presented from two periods with very\
  \ different levels of solar activity. At a resolution of about 25'', the 1.3 mm\
  \ wavelength images show temperatures on the disk that vary over about a 2000 K\
  \ range. Active regions and plages are among the hotter features, while a large\
  \ sunspot umbra shows up as a depression, and filament channels are relatively cool.\
  \ Prominences above the solar limb are a common feature of the single-dish images."

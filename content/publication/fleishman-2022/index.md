abstract: Solar flares, driven by prompt release of free magnetic energy in the solar
  corona1,2, are known to accelerate a substantial portion (ten per cent or more)3,4
  of available electrons to high energies. Hard X-rays, produced by high-energy electrons
  accelerated in the flare5, require a high ambient density for their detection. This
  restricts the observed volume to denser regions that do not necessarily sample the
  entire volume of accelerated electrons6. Here we report evolving spatially resolved
  distributions of thermal and non-thermal electrons in a solar flare derived from
  microwave observations that show the true extent of the acceleration region. These
  distributions show a volume filled with only (or almost only) non-thermal electrons
  while being depleted of the thermal plasma, implying that all electrons have experienced
  a prominent acceleration there. This volume is isolated from a surrounding, more
  typical flare plasma of mainly thermal particles with a smaller proportion of non-thermal
  electrons. This highly efficient acceleration happens in the same volume in which
  the free magnetic energy is being released2.

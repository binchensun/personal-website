abstract: Magnetic reconnection is the key mechanism for energy release in solar eruptions,
  where the high-temperature emission is the primary diagnostic for investigating
  the plasma properties during the reconnection process. Non-thermal broadening of
  high-temperature lines has been observed in both the reconnection current sheet
  (CS) and flare loop-top regions by UV spectrometers, but its origin remains unclear.
  In this work, we use a recently developed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
  (MHD) simulation to model magnetic reconnection in the standard solar flare geometry
  and reveal highly dynamic plasma flows in the reconnection regions. We calculate
  the synthetic profiles of the Fe XXI 1354 Å line observed by the Interface Region
  Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft by using parameters of the MHD model, including
  plasma density, temperature, and velocity. Our model shows that the turbulent bulk
  plasma flows in the CS and flare loop-top regions are responsible for the non-thermal
  broadening of the Fe XXI emission line. The modeled non-thermal velocity ranges
  from tens of km s−1 to more than two hundred km s−1, which is consistent with the
  IRIS observations. Simulated 2D spectral line maps around the reconnection region
  also reveal highly dynamic downwflow structures where the high non-thermal velocity
  is large, which is consistent with the observations as well.

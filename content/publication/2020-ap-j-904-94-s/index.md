abstract: Solar flares are sudden energy release events in the solar corona, resulting
  from magnetic reconnection, that accelerate particles and heat the ambient plasma.
  During a flare, there are often multiple temporally and spatially separated individual
  energy release episodes that can be difficult to resolve depending on the observing
  instrument. We present multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy observations of
  multiple electron acceleration episodes during a GOES B1.7-class two-ribbon flare
  on 2012 February 25, observed simultaneously with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
  Array at 1-2 GHz, the Reuven Ramatay High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager in X-rays,
  and the Solar Dynamics Observatory in extreme ultraviolet. During the initial phase
  of the flare, five radio bursts were observed. A nonthermal X-ray source was seen
  to be cotemporal but not cospatial with the first three radio bursts. Their radio
  spectra are interpreted as optically thick gyrosynchrotron emission. By fitting
  the radio spectra with a gyrosynchrotron model, we derive the magnetic field strength
  and nonthermal electron spectral parameters in each acceleration episode. Notably,
  the nonthermal parameters derived from X-rays differ considerably from the nonthermal
  parameters inferred from the radio. The observations are indicative of multiple
  cotemporal acceleration episodes during the impulsive phase of a solar microflare.
  The X-ray and radio burst sources likely originate from separate electron distributions
  in different magnetic loops.

abstract: Magnetic flux ropes are the centerpiece of solar eruptions. Direct measurements
  for the magnetic field of flux ropes are crucial for understanding the triggering
  and energy release processes, yet they remain heretofore elusive. Here we report
  microwave imaging spectroscopy observations of an M1.4-class solar flare that occurred
  on 2017 September 6, using data obtained by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array.
  This flare event is associated with a partial eruption of a twisted filament observed
  in H$α$ by the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The extreme
  ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray signatures of the event are generally consistent with
  the standard scenario of eruptive flares, with the presence of double flare ribbons
  connected by a bright flare arcade. Intriguingly, this partial eruption event features
  a microwave counterpart, whose spatial and temporal evolution closely follow the
  filament seen in H$α$ and EUV. The spectral properties of the microwave source are
  consistent with nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation. Using spatially resolved microwave
  spectral analysis, we derive the magnetic field strength along the filament spine,
  which ranges from 600 to 1400 Gauss from its apex to the legs. The results agree
  well with the nonlinear force-free magnetic model extrapolated from the preflare
  photospheric magnetogram. We conclude that the microwave counterpart of the erupting
  filament is likely due to flare-accelerated electrons injected into the filament-hosting
  magnetic flux rope cavity following the newly reconnected magnetic field lines.

 abstract = {In this paper, we devote ourselves to interpreting the short-lived
absorptive type III-like microwave bursts in the 2006 December
13 flare event observed with high temporal and spectral
resolutions (8 ms and 10 MHz) by the Chinese Solar Broadband
Radio Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou) at 2.6-3.8 GHz. In the
decimeter-centimeter wavelength range, we first present the
observations of short-lived bursts represented as a number of
absorptive ``spikes'' superposed on the type IV continuum that
can be connected by fast-drifting lines. The mean drift rate,
the instantaneous bandwidth, and the absorption depth of these
absorptive spikes are about -12 GHz s$^-1$, 70 MHz, and 40%,
respectively. The duration at a single frequency band can be
less than the instrument resolution of 8 ms. On the basis of
numerical investigations of the loss-cone instability, we
suggest that fragmented electron injections with durations of as
short as several milliseconds into the loss cone could be the
most appropriate mechanism with which to explain the bursts. The
length of an electron beam is estimated to be about 400 km, on
the basis of the observational results. These injections may be
related to the fragmented energy release processes during the
flare. We also observe some absorptive type III-like bursts
accompanying ordinary type III bursts with reverse drifts. They
start at the same frequency, and the starting frequency slowly
drifts to the low-frequency region. This could be a signature of
propagating bidirectional electron beams originating near the
reconnection region.},

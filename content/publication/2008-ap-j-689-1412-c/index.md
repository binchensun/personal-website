abstract: In this paper, we devote ourselves to interpreting the short-lived absorptive
  type III-like microwave bursts in the 2006 December 13 flare event observed with
  high temporal and spectral resolutions (8 ms and 10 MHz) by the Chinese Solar Broadband
  Radio Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou) at 2.6-3.8 GHz. In the decimeter-centimeter wavelength
  range, we first present the observations of short-lived bursts represented as a
  number of absorptive ``spikes'' superposed on the type IV continuum that can be
  connected by fast-drifting lines. The mean drift rate, the instantaneous bandwidth,
  and the absorption depth of these absorptive spikes are about -12 GHz s$^-1$, 70
  MHz, and 40%, respectively. The duration at a single frequency band can be less
  than the instrument resolution of 8 ms. On the basis of numerical investigations
  of the loss-cone instability, we suggest that fragmented electron injections with
  durations of as short as several milliseconds into the loss cone could be the most
  appropriate mechanism with which to explain the bursts. The length of an electron
  beam is estimated to be about 400 km, on the basis of the observational results.
  These injections may be related to the fragmented energy release processes during
  the flare. We also observe some absorptive type III-like bursts accompanying ordinary
  type III bursts with reverse drifts. They start at the same frequency, and the starting
  frequency slowly drifts to the low-frequency region. This could be a signature of
  propagating bidirectional electron beams originating near the reconnection region.

abstract: Radio bursts from nearby active M-dwarfs have been frequently reported and
  extensively studied in solar or planetary paradigms. Whereas, their substructures
  or fine structures remain rarely explored despite their potential significance in
  diagnosing the plasma and magnetic field properties of the star. Such studies in
  the past have been limited by the sensitivity of radio telescopes. Here we report
  the inspiring results from the high time-resolution observations of a known flare
  star AD Leo with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We detected
  many radio bursts in the 2 days of observations with fine structures in the form
  of numerous millisecond-scale sub-bursts. Sub-bursts on the first day display stripe-like
  shapes with nearly uniform frequency drift rates, which are possibly stellar analogs
  to Jovian S-bursts. Sub-bursts on the second day, however, reveal a different blob-like
  shape with random occurrence patterns and are akin to solar radio spikes. The new
  observational results suggest that the intense emission from AD Leo is driven by
  electron cyclotron maser instability, which may be related to stellar flares or
  interactions with a planetary companion.

abstract: We report striking Doppler velocity gradients observed during the well-observed
  2017 September 10 solar flare, and argue that they are consistent with the presence
  of an above-the-looptop termination shock beneath the flare current sheet. Observations
  from the Hinode Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer measure plasma sheet Doppler
  shifts up to 35 km s-1 during the late-phase of the event. By comparing these line-of-sight
  flows with plane-of-sky (POS) measurements, we calculate total velocity downflows
  of 200+ km s-1, orientated ≈6-10° out of the POS. The observed velocities drop rapidly
  at the base of the hot plasma sheet seen in extreme ultraviolet, consistent with
  simulated velocity profiles predicted by our 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics model that
  features a termination shock at the same location. Finally, the striking velocity
  deceleration aligns spatially with the suppression of Fe XXIV non-thermal velocities,
  and a 35-50 keV hard X-ray looptop source observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
  Solar Spectroscopic Imager. Together, these observations are consistent with the
  presence of a possible termination shock within the X8.2-class solar flare.

 abstract = {Nonthermal sources located above bright flare arcades, referred to as
the ``above-the-loop-top'' sources, have been often suggested as
the primary electron acceleration site in major solar flares.
The X8.2 limb flare on 2017 September 10 features such an above-
the-loop-top source, which was observed in both microwaves and
hard X-rays (HXRs) by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and
the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager,
respectively. By combining the microwave and HXR imaging
spectroscopy observations with multifilter extreme ultraviolet
and soft X-ray imaging data, we derive the coronal magnetic
field and energetic electron distribution of the source over a
broad energy range from $łt$10 keV up to \ensuremath∼MeV
during the early impulsive phase of the flare. The source has a
strong magnetic field of over 800 G. The best-fit electron
distribution consists of a thermal ``core'' from
\ensuremath∼25 MK plasma. A nonthermal power-law ``tail''
joins the thermal core at \ensuremath∼16 keV with a
spectral index of \ensuremath∼3.6, which breaks down at
above \ensuremath∼160 keV to $\gt$6.0. Temporally
resolved analysis suggests that the electron distribution above
the break energy rapidly hardens with the spectral index
decreasing from $\gt$20 to \ensuremath∼6.0 within 20 s,
or less than \ensuremath∼10 Alfvén crossing times in
the source. These results provide strong support for the above-
the-loop-top source as the primary site where an ongoing bulk
acceleration of energetic electrons is taking place very early
in the flare energy release.},

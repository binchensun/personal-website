abstract: Nonthermal sources located above bright flare arcades, referred to as the
  ``above-the-loop-top'' sources, have been often suggested as the primary electron
  acceleration site in major solar flares. The X8.2 limb flare on 2017 September 10
  features such an above- the-loop-top source, which was observed in both microwaves
  and hard X-rays (HXRs) by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and the Reuven Ramaty
  High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, respectively. By combining the microwave
  and HXR imaging spectroscopy observations with multifilter extreme ultraviolet and
  soft X-ray imaging data, we derive the coronal magnetic field and energetic electron
  distribution of the source over a broad energy range from $łt$10 keV up to ensuremath∼MeV
  during the early impulsive phase of the flare. The source has a strong magnetic
  field of over 800 G. The best-fit electron distribution consists of a thermal ``core''
  from ensuremath∼25 MK plasma. A nonthermal power-law ``tail'' joins the thermal
  core at ensuremath∼16 keV with a spectral index of ensuremath∼3.6, which breaks
  down at above ensuremath∼160 keV to $gt$6.0. Temporally resolved analysis suggests
  that the electron distribution above the break energy rapidly hardens with the spectral
  index decreasing from $gt$20 to ensuremath∼6.0 within 20 s, or less than ensuremath∼10
  Alfvén crossing times in the source. These results provide strong support for the
  above- the-loop-top source as the primary site where an ongoing bulk acceleration
  of energetic electrons is taking place very early in the flare energy release.

abstract: Through the data around 3 GHz from the Radio Spectrometer in Huairou, Beijing,
  zebra-pattern structures from the 21 April 2002 event have been studied. Zebra stripes
  consist of periodically pulsating superfine structures in this event. An analysis
  of temporal profiles of intensities at multiple frequency channels shows that the
  Gaussian temporal profiles of pulse groups on zebra stripes are caused by drifting
  zebra stripes with Gaussian spectral profiles. The observed quasiperiodic pulsations
  with about 30 ms period have a peculiar feature of oscillation near a steady state,
  probably resulting from relaxation oscillations, which modulate the electron cyclotron
  maser emission that forms the zebra stripes during the process of wave particle
  interactions. All the main properties of the zebra stripes with pulsating superfine
  structures indicate that the double plasma resonance model might be the most suitable
  one, with the relaxation oscillations, to form the superfine structures. The model
  of LaBelle et al. ( Astrophys. J. 593, 1195, 2003) could not account for the observed
  properties of zebra-pattern structures in this event nor for most zebra-pattern
  structures occupying a wide frequency range, mainly because the allowable frequency
  range of the zebra-pattern structures in their model is too narrow to reproduce
  the observed zebras.

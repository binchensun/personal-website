 abstract = {We present results from the the first campaign of dedicated solar
observations undertaken by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope
ARray (NuSTAR) hard X-ray (HXR) telescope. Designed as an
astrophysics mission, NuSTAR nonetheless has the capability of
directly imaging the Sun at HXR energies ($\gt$3 keV) with an
increase in sensitivity of at least two magnitude compared to
current non-focusing telescopes. In this paper we describe the
scientific areas where NuSTAR will make major improvements on
existing solar measurements. We report on the techniques used to
observe the Sun with NuSTAR, their limitations and
complications, and the procedures developed to optimize solar
data quality derived from our experience with the initial solar
observations. These first observations are briefly described,
including the measurement of the Fe K-shell lines in a decaying
X-class flare, HXR emission from high in the solar corona, and
full-disk HXR images of the Sun.},

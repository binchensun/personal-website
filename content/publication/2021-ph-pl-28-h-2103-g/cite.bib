 abstract = {The energy conversion rate in Petschek-type reconnection is modeled by
parameterizing it with the reconnection rate and a dimensionless
factor associated with the structure across the reconnection
exhaust. We determine this factor by solving for the magnetic
field and density change over the magnetohydrodynamic
transitions, which bound the outflow exhaust. With a stronger
guide field and/or lower plasma \ensuremathβ, the
fraction of the reconnecting magnetic field energy, which is
transferred into the plasma, can decrease, but is lower-bounded
by half of the reconnecting magnetic field energy. The
prediction agrees reasonably well with the results in particle-
in-cell simulations. We discuss implications to our
understanding of energy transfer in reconnection and
applications for finding the energy conversion rate in solar
flares.},

abstract: Nonthermal loop-top sources in solar flares are the most prominent observational
  signatures that suggest energy release and particle acceleration in the solar corona.
  Although several scenarios for particle acceleration have been proposed, the origin
  of the loop-top sources remains unclear. Here we present a model that combines a
  large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a two-ribbon flare with a particle
  acceleration and transport model for investigating electron acceleration by a fast-mode
  termination shock (TS) at the loop top. Our model provides spatially resolved electron
  distribution that evolves in response to the dynamic flare geometry. We find a concave-
  downward magnetic structure located below the flare TS, induced by the fast reconnection
  downflows. It acts as a magnetic trap to confine the electrons at the loop top for
  an extended period of time. The electrons are energized significantly as they cross
  the shock front, and eventually build up a power-law energy spectrum extending to
  hundreds of kiloelectron volts. We suggest that this particle acceleration and transport
  scenario driven by a flare TS is a viable interpretation for the observed nonthermal
  loop-top sources.

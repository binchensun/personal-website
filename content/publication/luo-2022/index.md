abstract: Flare-associated quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in radio and X-ray wavelengths,
  particularly those related to nonthermal electrons, contain important information
  about the energy release and transport processes during flares. However, the paucity
  of spatially resolved observations of such QPPs with a fast time cadence has been
  an obstacle for us to further understand their physical nature. Here, we report
  observations of such a QPP event that occurred during the impulsive phase of a C1.8-class
  eruptive solar flare using radio imaging spectroscopy data from the Karl G. Jansky
  Very Large Array (VLA) and complementary X-ray imaging and spectroscopy data. The
  radio QPPs, observed by the VLA in the 1-2 GHz with a subsecond cadence, are shown
  as three spatially distinct sources with different physical characteristics. Two
  radio sources are located near the conjugate footpoints of the erupting magnetic
  flux rope with opposite senses of polarization. One of the sources displays a QPP
  behavior with a ~ 5 s period. The third radio source, located at the top of the
  postflare arcade, coincides with the location of an X-ray source and shares a similar
  period of ~ 25-45 s. We show that the two oppositely polarized radio sources are
  likely due to coherent electron cyclotron maser emission. On the other hand, the
  looptop QPP source, observed in both radio and X-rays, is consistent with incoherent
  gyrosynchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, respectively. We conclude that the
  concurrent, but spatially distinct QPP sources must involve multiple mechanisms
  which operate in different magnetic loop systems and at different periods.

abstract: As one of the most spectacular energy release events in the solar system,
  solar flares are generally powered by magnetic reconnection in the solar corona.
  As a result of the re- arrangement of magnetic field topology after the reconnection
  process, a series of new loop-like magnetic structures are often formed and are
  known as flare loops. A hot diffuse region, consisting of around 5-10 MK plasma,
  is also observed above the loops and is called a supra-arcade fan. Often, dark,
  tadpole- like structures are seen to descend through the bright supra- arcade fans.
  It remains unclear what role these so-called supra- arcade downflows (SADs) play
  in heating the flaring coronal plasma. Here we show a unique flare observation,
  where many SADs collide with the flare loops and strongly heat the loops to a temperature
  of 10-20 MK. Several of these interactions generate clear signatures of quasi-periodic
  enhancement in the full-Sun- integrated soft X-ray emission, providing an alternative
  interpretation for quasi-periodic pulsations that are commonly observed during solar
  and stellar flares.

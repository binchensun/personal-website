abstract: We report the first science results from the newly completed Expanded Owens
  Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), which obtained excellent microwave (MW) imaging spectroscopy
  observations of SOL2017-09-10, a classic partially occulted solar limb flare associated
  with an erupting flux rope. This event is also well- covered by the Reuven Ramaty
  High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in hard X-rays (HXRs). We present
  an overview of this event focusing on MW and HXR data, both associated with high-energy
  nonthermal electrons, and we discuss them within the context of the flare geometry
  and evolution revealed by extreme ultraviolet observations from the Atmospheric
  Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The EOVSA and RHESSI
  data reveal the evolving spatial and energy distribution of high-energy electrons
  throughout the entire flaring region. The results suggest that the MW and HXR sources
  largely arise from a common nonthermal electron population, although the MW imaging
  spectroscopy provides information over a much larger volume of the corona.

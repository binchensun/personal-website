 abstract = {Solar flares are due to the catastrophic release of magnetic energy in
the Sun's corona, resulting in plasma heating, mass motions,
particle acceleration, and radiation emitted from radio to
\ensuremathγ-ray wavelengths. They are associated with
global coronal eruptions of plasma into the interplanetary
medium—coronal mass ejections—that can
result in a variety of “space
weather” phenomena. Flares release energy
over a vast range of energies, from
\ensuremath∼10$^23$ ergs (nanoflares) to more than
10$^32$ ergs. Solar flares are a phenomenon of general
astrophysical interest, allowing detailed study of magnetic
energy release, eruptive processes, shock formation and
propagation, particle acceleration and transport, and radiative
processes. Observations at radio wavelengths offer unique
diagnostics of the physics of flares. To fully exploit these
diagnostics requires the means of performing time-resolved
imaging spectropolarimetry. Recent observations with the Jansky
Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Expanded Owens Valley Solar
Array (EOVSA), supported by extensive development in forward
modeling, have demonstrated the power of the approach. The ngVLA
has the potential to bring our understanding of flare processes
to a new level through its combination of high spatial
resolution, broad frequency range, and imaging dynamic
range—especially when used in concert with multi-
wavelength observations and data at hard X-ray energies.},

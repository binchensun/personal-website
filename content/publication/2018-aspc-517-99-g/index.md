abstract: Solar flares are due to the catastrophic release of magnetic energy in the
  Sun's corona, resulting in plasma heating, mass motions, particle acceleration,
  and radiation emitted from radio to ensuremathγ-ray wavelengths. They are associated
  with global coronal eruptions of plasma into the interplanetary medium—coronal mass
  ejections—that can result in a variety of “space weather” phenomena. Flares release
  energy over a vast range of energies, from ensuremath∼10$^23$ ergs (nanoflares)
  to more than 10$^32$ ergs. Solar flares are a phenomenon of general astrophysical
  interest, allowing detailed study of magnetic energy release, eruptive processes,
  shock formation and propagation, particle acceleration and transport, and radiative
  processes. Observations at radio wavelengths offer unique diagnostics of the physics
  of flares. To fully exploit these diagnostics requires the means of performing time-resolved
  imaging spectropolarimetry. Recent observations with the Jansky Very Large Array
  (JVLA) and the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), supported by extensive
  development in forward modeling, have demonstrated the power of the approach. The
  ngVLA has the potential to bring our understanding of flare processes to a new level
  through its combination of high spatial resolution, broad frequency range, and imaging
  dynamic range—especially when used in concert with multi- wavelength observations
  and data at hard X-ray energies.

abstract: The X8.2-class limb flare on 2017 September 10 is among the best studied
  solar flare events owing to its great similarity to the standard flare model and
  the broad coverage by multiple spacecraft and ground-based observations. These multiwavelength
  observations indicate that electron acceleration and transport are efficient in
  the reconnection and flare looptop regions. However, there lacks a comprehensive
  model for explaining and interpreting the multi-faceted observations. In this work,
  we model the electron acceleration and transport in the early impulsive phase of
  this flare. We solve the Parker transport equation that includes the primary acceleration
  mechanism during magnetic reconnection in the large-scale flare region modeled by
  MHD simulations. We find that electrons are accelerated up to several MeV and fill
  a large volume of the reconnection region, similar to the observations shown in
  microwaves. The electron spatial distribution and spectral shape in the looptop
  region agree well with those derived from the microwave and hard X-ray emissions
  before magnetic islands grow large and dominate the acceleration. Future emission
  modelings using the electron maps will enable direct comparison with microwave and
  hard X-ray observations. These results shed new light on the electron acceleration
  and transport in a broad region of solar flares within a data-constrained realistic
  flare geometry.

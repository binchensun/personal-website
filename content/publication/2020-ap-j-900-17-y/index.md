abstract: Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in powering solar flares, production
  of energetic particles, and plasma heating. However, where the magnetic reconnections
  occur, how and where the released magnetic energy is transported, and how it is
  converted to other forms remain unclear. Here we report recurring bidirectional
  plasma outflows located within a large-scale plasma sheet observed in extreme-ultraviolet
  emission and scattered white light during the post-impulsive gradual phase of the
  X8.2 solar flare on 2017 September 10. Each of the bidirectional outflows originates
  in the plasma sheet from a discrete site, identified as a magnetic reconnection
  site. These reconnection sites reside at very low altitudes (<180 Mm, or 0.26
  solar radii) above the top of the flare arcade, a distance only <3% of
  the total length of a plasma sheet that extends to at least 10 solar radii.
  Each arrival of sunward outflows at the loop-top region appears to coincide with
  an impulsive microwave and X-ray burst dominated by a hot source (10-20 MK) at the
  loop top and a nonthermal microwave burst located in the loop-leg region. We propose
  that the reconnection outflows transport the magnetic energy released at localized
  magnetic reconnection sites outward in the form of kinetic energy flux and/or electromagnetic
  Poynting flux. The sunward-directed energy flux induces particle acceleration and
  plasma heating in the post-flare arcades, observed as the hot and nonthermal flare
  emissions.

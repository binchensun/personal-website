abstract: When and where the magnetic field energy is released and converted in eruptive
  solar flares remains an outstanding topic in solar physics. To shed light on this
  question, here we report multiwavelength observations of a C9.4-class eruptive limb
  flare that occurred on 2017 August 20. The flare, accompanied by a magnetic flux
  rope eruption and a white light coronal mass ejection, features three post-impulsive
  X-ray and microwave bursts immediately following its main impulsive phase. For each
  burst, both microwave and X-ray imaging suggest that the nonthermal electrons are
  located in the above-the-loop-top region. Interestingly, contrary to many other
  flares, the peak flux of the three post-impulsive microwave and X-ray bursts shows
  an increase for later bursts. Spectral analysis reveals that the sources have a
  hardening spectral index, suggesting a more efficient electron acceleration into
  the later post-impulsive bursts. We observe a positive correlation between the acceleration
  of the magnetic flux rope and the nonthermal energy release during the post-impulsive
  bursts in the same event. Intriguingly, different from some other eruptive events,
  this correlation does not hold for the main impulse phase of this event, which we
  interpret as energy release due to the tether-cutting reconnection before the primary
  flux rope acceleration occurs. In addition, using footpoint brightenings at conjugate
  flare ribbons, a weakening reconnection guide field is inferred, which may also
  contribute to the hardening of the nonthermal electrons during the post-impulsive
  phase.

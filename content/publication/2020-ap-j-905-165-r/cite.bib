 abstract = {In this study, we investigate motions in the hot plasma above the flare
loops during the 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare event. We examine
the region to the south of the main flare arcade, where there is
data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and
the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode. We
find that there are initial blueshifts of 20-60 km s$^-1$
observed in this region in the Fe XXI line in IRIS and the Fe
XXIV line in EIS, and that the locations of these blueshifts
move southward along the arcade over the course of about 10
minutes. The cadence of IRIS allows us to follow the evolution
of these flows, and we find that at each location where there is
an initial blueshift in the Fe XXI line, there are damped
oscillations in the Doppler velocity with periods of
~400 s. We conclude that these periods are
independent of loop length, ruling out magnetoacoustic standing
modes as a possible mechanism. Microwave observations from the
Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) indicate that there
are nonthermal emissions in the region where the Doppler shifts
are observed, indicating that accelerated particles are present.
We suggest that the flows and oscillations are due to motions of
the magnetic field that are caused by reconnection outflows
disturbing the loop-top region.},

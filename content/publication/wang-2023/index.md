abstract: Solar type III radio bursts are generated by beams of energetic electrons
  that travel along open magnetic field lines through the corona and into interplanetary
  space. However, understanding the source of these electrons and how they escape
  into interplanetary space remains an outstanding topic. Here we report multi-instrument,
  multiperspective observations of an interplanetary type III radio burst event shortly
  after the second perihelion of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This event was associated
  with a solar jet that produced an impulsive microwave burst event recorded by the
  Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. The type III burst event also coincided with
  the detection of enhanced in situ energetic electrons recorded by both PSP at 0.37
  au and WIND at 1 au, which were located very closely on the Parker spiral longitudinally.
  The close timing association and magnetic connectivity suggest that the in situ
  energetic electrons originated from the jet's magnetic reconnection region. Intriguingly,
  microwave imaging spectroscopy results suggest that the escaping energetic electrons
  were injected into a large opening angle of about 90Â°, which is at least nine times
  broader than the apparent width of the jet spire. Our findings provide an interpretation
  for the previously reported, longitudinally broad spatial distribution of flare
  locations associated with prompt energetic electron events and have important implications
  for understanding the origin and distribution of energetic electrons in interplanetary
  space.

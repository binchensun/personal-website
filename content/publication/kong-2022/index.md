abstract: A number of double coronal X-ray sources have been observed during solar
  flares by RHESSI, where the two sources reside at different sides of the inferred
  reconnection site. However, where and how these X-ray-emitting electrons are accelerated
  remains unclear. Here we present the first model of the double coronal hard X-ray
  (HXR) sources, where electrons are accelerated by a pair of termination shocks driven
  by bidirectional fast reconnection outflows. We model the acceleration and transport
  of electrons in the flare region by numerically solving the Parker transport equation
  using velocity and magnetic fields from the macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic simulation
  of a flux rope eruption. We show that electrons can be efficiently accelerated by
  the termination shocks and high-energy electrons mainly concentrate around the two
  shocks. The synthetic HXR emission images display two distinct sources extending
  to $>$100 keV below and above the reconnection region, with the upper source much
  fainter than the lower one. The HXR energy spectra of the two coronal sources show
  similar spectral slopes, consistent with the observations. Our simulation results
  suggest that the flare termination shock can be a promising particle acceleration
  mechanism in explaining the double-source nonthermal emissions in solar flares.

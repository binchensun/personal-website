abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a universal process that powers explosive energy-release
  events such as solar flares, geomagnetic substorms and some astrophysical jets.
  A characteristic feature of magnetic reconnection is the production of fast reconnection
  outflow jets near the plasma Alfv√©n speeds1,2. In eruptive solar flares, dark finger-shaped
  plasma downflows moving toward the flare arcade have been commonly regarded as the
  principal observational evidence for such reconnection-driven outflows3,4. However,
  they often show a speed much slower than that expected in reconnection theories5,6,
  challenging the reconnection-driven energy-release scenario in standard flare models.
  Here we present a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model of solar flares.
  By comparing the model predictions with the observed plasma downflow features, we
  conclude that these dark downflows are self-organized structures formed in a turbulent
  interface region below the flare termination shock where the outflows meet the flare
  arcade, a phenomenon analogous to the formation of similar structures in supernova
  remnants. This interface region hosts a myriad of turbulent flows, electron currents
  and shocks, crucial for flare energy release and particle acceleration.

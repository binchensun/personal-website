 abstract = {Radio bursts with fine structures in decimetric-centimetric wave range
are generally believed to manifest the primary energy release
process during flare/CME events. By spectropolarimeters in 1-2
GHz, 2.6-3.8 GHz, and 5.2-7.6 GHz at NAOC/Huairou with very high
temporal (1.25-8 ms) and spectral (4-20 MHz) resolutions, the
zebra patterns, spikes, and new types of radio fine structures
with mixed frequency drift features are observed during several
significant flare/CME events. In this paper we will discuss the
occurrence of radio fine structures during the impulsive phase
of flares and/or CME initiations, which may be connected to the
magnetic reconnection processes.},

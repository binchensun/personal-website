abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are frequently detected in solar and stellar
  flares, but the underlying physical mechanisms are still to be ascertained. Here,
  we show microwave QPPs during a solar flare originating from quasi-periodic magnetic
  reconnection at the flare current sheet. They appear as two vertically detached
  but closely related sources with the brighter ones located at flare loops and the
  weaker ones along the stretched current sheet. Although the brightness temperatures
  of the two microwave sources differ greatly, they vary in phase with periods of
  about 10-20 s and 30-60 s. The gyrosynchrotron-dominated microwave spectra also
  present a quasi-periodic soft-hard-soft evolution. These results suggest that relevant
  high-energy electrons are accelerated by quasi-periodic reconnection, likely arising
  from the modulation of magnetic islands within the current sheet as validated by
  a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation.

abstract: Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant energy release mechanism
  in solar flares. The standard flare model predicts both downward and upward outflow
  plasmas with speeds close to the coronal Alfvén speed. Yet, spectroscopic observations
  of such outflows, especially the downflows, are extremely rare. With observations
  of the newly launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), we report the
  detection of a greatly redshifted (åisebox-0.5ex~125 km s$^-1$ along the line of
  sight) Fe XXI 1354.08 Å emission line with a rs̊ebox-0.5ex~100 km s$^-1$ nonthermal
  width at the reconnection site of a flare. The redshifted Fe XXI feature coincides
  spatially with the loop-top X-ray source observed by RHESSI. We interpret this large
  redshift as the signature of downward-moving reconnection outflow/hot retracting
  loops. Imaging observations from both IRIS and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
  (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory also reveal the eruption and reconnection
  processes. Fast downward-propagating blobs along these loops are also found from
  cool emission lines (e.g., Si IV, O IV, C II, Mg II) and images of AIA and IRIS.
  Furthermore, the entire Fe XXI line is blueshifted by rae̊box-0.5ex~260 km s$^-1$
  at the loop footpoints, where the cool lines mentioned above all exhibit obvious
  redshift, a result that is consistent with the scenario of chromospheric evaporation
  induced by downward-propagating nonthermal electrons from the reconnection site.

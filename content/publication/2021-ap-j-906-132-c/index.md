abstract: We present the first results of a solar radio event observed with the Owens
  Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array at metric wavelengths. We examine
  a complex event consisting of multiple radio sources/bursts associated with a fast
  coronal mass ejection (CME) and an M2.1 GOES soft X-ray flare from 2015 September
  20. Images of 9 s cadence are used to analyze the event over a 120 minute period,
  and solar emission is observed out to a distance of ~3.5 solar radii, with
  an instantaneous bandwidth covering 22 MHz within the frequency range of 40-70 MHz.
  We present our results from the investigation of the radio event, focusing particularly
  on one burst source that exhibits outward motion, which we classify as a moving
  type IV burst. We image the event at multiple frequencies and use the source centroids
  to obtain the velocity for the outward motion. Spatial and temporal comparison with
  observations of the CME in white light from the C2 coronagraph of the Large Angle
  and Spectrometric COronagraph, indicates an association of the outward motion with
  the core of the CME. By performing graduated-cylindrical-shell reconstruction of
  the CME, we constrain the density in the volume. The electron plasma frequency obtained
  from the density estimates do not allow us to completely dismiss plasma emission
  as the underlying mechanism. However, based on source height and smoothness of the
  emission in frequency and time, we argue that gyrosynchrotron is the more plausible
  mechanism. We use gyrosynchrotron spectral-fitting techniques to estimate the evolving
  physical conditions during the outward motion of this burst source.

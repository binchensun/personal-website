 abstract = {We present the first results of a solar radio event observed with the
Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array at metric
wavelengths. We examine a complex event consisting of multiple
radio sources/bursts associated with a fast coronal mass
ejection (CME) and an M2.1 GOES soft X-ray flare from 2015
September 20. Images of 9 s cadence are used to analyze the
event over a 120 minute period, and solar emission is observed
out to a distance of ≍3.5 R$_\ensuremathødot$, with an
instantaneous bandwidth covering 22 MHz within the frequency
range of 40-70 MHz. We present our results from the
investigation of the radio event, focusing particularly on one
burst source that exhibits outward motion, which we classify as
a moving type IV burst. We image the event at multiple
frequencies and use the source centroids to obtain the velocity
for the outward motion. Spatial and temporal comparison with
observations of the CME in white light from the C2 coronagraph
of the Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph, indicates an
association of the outward motion with the core of the CME. By
performing graduated-cylindrical-shell reconstruction of the
CME, we constrain the density in the volume. The electron plasma
frequency obtained from the density estimates do not allow us to
completely dismiss plasma emission as the underlying mechanism.
However, based on source height and smoothness of the emission
in frequency and time, we argue that gyrosynchrotron is the more
plausible mechanism. We use gyrosynchrotron spectral-fitting
techniques to estimate the evolving physical conditions during
the outward motion of this burst source.},

 abstract = {Solar flare termination shocks have been suggested as one of the
promising drivers for particle acceleration in solar flares, yet
observational evidence remains rare. By utilizing radio dynamic
spectroscopic imaging of decimetric stochastic spike bursts in
an eruptive flare, Chen et al. found that the bursts form a
dynamic surface-like feature located at the ending points of
fast plasma downflows above the looptop, interpreted as a flare
termination shock. One piece of observational evidence that
strongly supports the termination shock interpretation is the
occasional split of the emission band into two finer lanes in
frequency, similar to the split-band feature seen in fast-
coronal-shock-driven type II radio bursts. Here, we perform
spatially, spectrally, and temporally resolved analysis of the
split-band feature of the flare termination shock event. We find
that the ensemble of the radio centroids from the two split-band
lanes each outlines a nearly co-spatial surface. The high-
frequency lane is located slightly below its low-frequency
counterpart by ~0.8 Mm, which strongly supports
the shock-upstream-downstream interpretation. Under this
scenario, the density compression ratio across the shock front
can be inferred from the frequency split, which implies a shock
with a Mach number of up to 2.0. Further, the spatiotemporal
evolution of the density compression along the shock front
agrees favorably with results from magnetohydrodynamics
simulations. We conclude that the detailed variations of the
shock compression ratio may be due to the impact of dynamic
plasma structures in the reconnection outflows, which results in
distortion of the shock front.},

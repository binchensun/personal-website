abstract: We report observations of type III radio bursts at decimeter wavelengths
  (type IIIdm bursts)—signatures of suprathermal electron beams propagating in the
  low corona—using the new technique of radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy provided
  by the recently upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. For the first time, type
  IIIdm bursts were imaged with high time and frequency resolution over a broad frequency
  band, allowing electron beam trajectories in the corona to be deduced. Together
  with simultaneous hard X-ray and extreme ultraviolet observations, we show that
  these beams emanate from an energy release site located in the low corona at a height
  below åisebox-0.5ex~15 Mm, and propagate along a bundle of discrete magnetic loops
  upward into the corona. Our observations enable direct measurements of the plasma
  density along the magnetic loops, and allow us to constrain the diameter of these
  loops to be less than 100 km. These overdense and ultra-thin loops reveal the fundamentally
  fibrous structure of the Sun's corona. The impulsive nature of the electron beams,
  their accessibility to different magnetic field lines, and the detailed structure
  of the magnetic release site revealed by the radio observations indicate that the
  localized energy release is highly fragmentary in time and space, supporting a bursty
  reconnection model that involves secondary magnetic structures for magnetic energy
  release and particle acceleration.

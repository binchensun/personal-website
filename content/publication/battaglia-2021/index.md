abstract: Even small solar flares can display a surprising level of complexity regarding
  their morphology and temporal evolution. Many of their properties, such as energy
  release and electron acceleration can be studied using highly complementary observations
  at X-ray and radio wavelengths. We present X-ray observations from the Reuven Ramaty
  High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager and radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky
  Very Large Array (VLA) of a series of GOES A3.4-B1.6 class flares observed on 2013
  April 23. The flares, as seen in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, originated from
  multiple locations within active region NOAA 11726. A veritable zoo of different
  radio emissions between 1 GHz and 2 GHz was observed cotemporally with the X-ray
  flares. In addition to broadband continuum emission, broadband short-lived bursts
  and narrowband spikes, indicative of accelerated electrons, were observed. However,
  these sources were located up to 150$″$ away from the flaring X-ray sources but
  only some of these emissions could be explained as signatures of electrons that
  were accelerated near the main flare site. For other sources, no obvious magnetic
  connection to the main flare site could be found. These emissions likely originate
  from secondary acceleration sites triggered by the flare, but may be due to reconnection
  and acceleration completely unrelated to the cotemporally observed flare. Thanks
  to the extremely high sensitivity of the VLA, not achieved with current X-ray instrumentation,
  it is shown that particle acceleration happens frequently and at multiple locations
  within a flaring active region.

 abstract = {Solar flare termination shocks have been suggested as one of the viable
mechanisms for accelerating electrons and ions to high energies.
Observational evidence of such shocks, however, remains rare.
Using radio dynamic spectroscopic imaging of a long-duration
C1.9 flare obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA), Chen et al. suggested that a type of coherent radio
bursts, referred to as ``stochastic spike bursts,'' were radio
signatures of nonthermal electrons interacting with myriad
density fluctuations at the front of a flare termination shock.
Here we report another stochastic spike burst event recorded
during the extended energy release phase of a long-duration
M8.4-class eruptive flare on 2012 March 10. VLA radio
spectroscopic imaging of the spikes in 1.0-1.6 GHz shows that,
similar to the case of Chen et al., the burst centroids form an
extended, \ensuremath∼10″-long structure in the corona.
By combining extreme-ultraviolet imaging observations of the
flare from two vantage points with hard X-ray and ultraviolet
observations of the flare ribbon brightenings, we reconstruct
the flare arcade in three dimensions. The results show that the
spike source is located at \ensuremath∼60 Mm above the
flare arcade, where a diffuse supra-arcade fan and multitudes of
plasma downflows are present. Although the flare arcade and
ribbons seen during the impulsive phase do not allow us to
clearly understand how the observed spike source location is
connected to the flare geometry, the cooling flare arcade
observed 2 hr later suggests that the spikes are located in the
above-the-loop-top region, where a termination shock presumably
forms.},

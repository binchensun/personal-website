abstract: Solar flare termination shocks have been suggested as one of the viable
  mechanisms for accelerating electrons and ions to high energies. Observational evidence
  of such shocks, however, remains rare. Using radio dynamic spectroscopic imaging
  of a long-duration C1.9 flare obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA),
  Chen et al. suggested that a type of coherent radio bursts, referred to as ``stochastic
  spike bursts,'' were radio signatures of nonthermal electrons interacting with myriad
  density fluctuations at the front of a flare termination shock. Here we report another
  stochastic spike burst event recorded during the extended energy release phase of
  a long-duration M8.4-class eruptive flare on 2012 March 10. VLA radio spectroscopic
  imaging of the spikes in 1.0-1.6 GHz shows that, similar to the case of Chen et
  al., the burst centroids form an extended, ensuremath∼10″-long structure in the
  corona. By combining extreme-ultraviolet imaging observations of the flare from
  two vantage points with hard X-ray and ultraviolet observations of the flare ribbon
  brightenings, we reconstruct the flare arcade in three dimensions. The results show
  that the spike source is located at ensuremath∼60 Mm above the flare arcade, where
  a diffuse supra-arcade fan and multitudes of plasma downflows are present. Although
  the flare arcade and ribbons seen during the impulsive phase do not allow us to
  clearly understand how the observed spike source location is connected to the flare
  geometry, the cooling flare arcade observed 2 hr later suggests that the spikes
  are located in the above-the-loop-top region, where a termination shock presumably
  forms.

abstract: Jets are ubiquitously present in both quiet and active regions on the Sun.
  They are widely believed to be driven by magnetic reconnection. A fan-spine structure
  has been frequently reported in some coronal jets and flares, and has been regarded
  as a signature of ongoing magnetic reconnection in a topology consisting of a magnetic
  null connected by a fan-like separatrix surface and a spine. However, for small-scale
  chromospheric jets, clear evidence of such structures is rather rare, although it
  has been implied in earlier works that showed an inverted-Y-shaped feature. Here
  we report high-resolution (0.″16) observations of a small-scale chromospheric jet
  obtained by the New Solar Telescope (NST) using 10830 ̊A filtergrams. Bi-directional
  flows were observed across the separatrix regions in the 10830 Å images, suggesting
  that the jet was produced due to magnetic reconnection. At the base of the jet,
  a fan-spine structure was clearly resolved by the NST, including the spine and the
  fan-like surface, as well as the loops before and after the reconnection. A major
  part of this fan-spine structure, with the exception of its bright footpoints and
  part of the base arc, was invisible in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray images
  (observed by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly and the X-Ray Telescope, respectively),
  indicating that the reconnection occurred in the upper chromosphere. Our observations
  suggest that the evolution of this chromospheric jet is consistent with a two-step
  reconnection scenario proposed by Török et al.

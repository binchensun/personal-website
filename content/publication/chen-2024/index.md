abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an
  unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a \"magnetic bottle\" structure,
  which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the
  flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles.
  However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational
  signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present
  the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic
  magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry.
  The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported
  by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength
  but also abruptly slowing plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact above-the-loop-top
  hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides the flare arcade.
  Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly
  concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that
  are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons
  are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only
  a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by
  plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi
  mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary
  electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights
  into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated
  electrons entering interplanetary space.

 abstract = {With observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, we
track the complete evolution of ~11 MK
evaporation flows in an M1.1 flare on 2014 September 6 and an
X1.6 flare on 2014 September 10. These hot flows, as indicated
by the blueshifted Fe xxi 1354.08 ̊A line, evolve smoothly
with a velocity decreasing exponentially from
~200 km s$^-1$ to almost stationary within a
few minutes. We find a good correlation between the flow
velocity and energy deposition rate as represented by the hard
X-ray flux observed with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager, or time derivative of the soft X-ray flux
observed with the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellites and the HINODE X-ray Telescope, which is in general
agreement with models of nonthermal electron heating. The
maximum blueshift of Fe xxi appears approximately at the same
time as or slightly after the impulsive enhancement of the
ultraviolet continuum and the Mg ii 2798.8 \Å line
emission, demonstrating that the evaporation flow is closely
related to heating of the lower chromosphere. Finally, while the
hot Fe xxi 1354.08 \r̊ line is entirely blueshifted with no
obvious rest component, cool chromospheric and transition region
lines like Si iv 1402.77 \r̊ are often not entirely
redshifted but just reveal an obvious red wing enhancement at
the ribbons, suggesting that the speed of chromospheric
condensation might be larger than previously thought.},

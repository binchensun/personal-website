abstract: On 2006 December 13 during the solar minimum, the superactive region NOAA
  10930 at the S05W33 disk location produced an X3.4/4B flare at 02:40UT. Fine structures
  were observed in the radio spectra, which included spikes, reverse slope-type III
  bursts, type-U burst, V-shaped burst, pulsations, zebra patterns, and firstly discovered
  sub-second spiky zebra-like structures, superimposed on the 2.6-3.8GHz type IV bursts.
  The radio fine structures during the impulsive phase of the flare may be closely
  associated with coronal structures during the magnetic- reconnection process, as
  revealed by Hinode soft X-ray images. Thus, these microwave fine structure observations
  may provide very useful diagnostics at the primary energy release sites when they
  occur in the impulsive flare phase. For this flare event, the estimated coronal
  magnetic field is about 50-170G in the rising phase of the flare with a source density
  of about 1 × 10$^11$cm$^-3$. The field strength and plasma density are about 90-200G
  and 1.27 × 10$^11$cm$^-3$ around the flare maximum.

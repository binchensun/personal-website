 abstract = {On 2006 December 13 during the solar minimum, the superactive region
NOAA 10930 at the S05W33 disk location produced an X3.4/4B flare
at 02:40UT. Fine structures were observed in the radio spectra,
which included spikes, reverse slope-type III bursts, type-U
burst, V-shaped burst, pulsations, zebra patterns, and firstly
discovered sub-second spiky zebra-like structures, superimposed
on the 2.6-3.8GHz type IV bursts. The radio fine structures
during the impulsive phase of the flare may be closely
associated with coronal structures during the magnetic-
reconnection process, as revealed by Hinode soft X-ray images.
Thus, these microwave fine structure observations may provide
very useful diagnostics at the primary energy release sites when
they occur in the impulsive flare phase. For this flare event,
the estimated coronal magnetic field is about 50-170G in the
rising phase of the flare with a source density of about 1
× 10$^11$cm$^-3$. The field strength and plasma
density are about 90-200G and 1.27 ×
10$^11$cm$^-3$ around the flare maximum.},

 abstract = {Jets are ubiquitously present in both quiet and active regions on the
Sun. They are widely believed to be driven by magnetic
reconnection. A fan-spine structure has been frequently reported
in some coronal jets and flares, and has been regarded as a
signature of ongoing magnetic reconnection in a topology
consisting of a magnetic null connected by a fan-like separatrix
surface and a spine. However, for small-scale chromospheric
jets, clear evidence of such structures is rather rare, although
it has been implied in earlier works that showed an
inverted-Y-shaped feature. Here we report high-resolution
(0.″16) observations of a small-scale chromospheric jet obtained
by the New Solar Telescope (NST) using 10830 ̊A
filtergrams. Bi-directional flows were observed across the
separatrix regions in the 10830 \Å images, suggesting that
the jet was produced due to magnetic reconnection. At the base
of the jet, a fan-spine structure was clearly resolved by the
NST, including the spine and the fan-like surface, as well as
the loops before and after the reconnection. A major part of
this fan-spine structure, with the exception of its bright
footpoints and part of the base arc, was invisible in the
extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray images (observed by the
Atmosphere Imaging Assembly and the X-Ray Telescope,
respectively), indicating that the reconnection occurred in the
upper chromosphere. Our observations suggest that the evolution
of this chromospheric jet is consistent with a two-step
reconnection scenario proposed by Török et al.},

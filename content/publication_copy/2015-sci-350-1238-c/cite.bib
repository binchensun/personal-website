 abstract = {Solar flares—the most powerful explosions in the solar
system—are also efficient particle accelerators,
capable of energizing a large number of charged particles to
relativistic speeds. A termination shock is often invoked in the
standard model of solar flares as a possible driver for particle
acceleration, yet its existence and role have remained
controversial. We present observations of a solar flare
termination shock and trace its morphology and dynamics using
high-cadence radio imaging spectroscopy. We show that a
disruption of the shock coincides with an abrupt reduction of
the energetic electron population. The observed properties of
the shock are well reproduced by simulations. These results
strongly suggest that a termination shock is responsible, at
least in part, for accelerating energetic electrons in solar
flares.},

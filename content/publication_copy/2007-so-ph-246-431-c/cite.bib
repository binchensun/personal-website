 abstract = {Through the data around 3 GHz from the Radio Spectrometer in Huairou,
Beijing, zebra-pattern structures from the 21 April 2002 event
have been studied. Zebra stripes consist of periodically
pulsating superfine structures in this event. An analysis of
temporal profiles of intensities at multiple frequency channels
shows that the Gaussian temporal profiles of pulse groups on
zebra stripes are caused by drifting zebra stripes with Gaussian
spectral profiles. The observed quasiperiodic pulsations with
about 30 ms period have a peculiar feature of oscillation near a
steady state, probably resulting from relaxation oscillations,
which modulate the electron cyclotron maser emission that forms
the zebra stripes during the process of wave particle
interactions. All the main properties of the zebra stripes with
pulsating superfine structures indicate that the double plasma
resonance model might be the most suitable one, with the
relaxation oscillations, to form the superfine structures. The
model of LaBelle et al. ( Astrophys. J. 593, 1195, 2003) could
not account for the observed properties of zebra-pattern
structures in this event nor for most zebra-pattern structures
occupying a wide frequency range, mainly because the allowable
frequency range of the zebra-pattern structures in their model
is too narrow to reproduce the observed zebras.},

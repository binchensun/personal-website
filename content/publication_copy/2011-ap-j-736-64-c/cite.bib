 abstract = {We present the first interferometric observation of a zebra-pattern
radio burst with simultaneous high spectral
(\ensuremathâ‰ˆ1 MHz) and high time (20 ms) resolution.
The Frequency-Agile Solar Radiotelescope Subsystem Testbed (FST)
and the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) were used in parallel to
observe the X1.5 flare on 2006 December 14. By using OVSA to
calibrate the FST, the source position of the zebra pattern can
be located on the solar disk. With the help of multi-wavelength
observations and a nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, the
zebra source is explored in relation to the magnetic field
configuration. New constraints are placed on the source size and
position as a function of frequency and time. We conclude that
the zebra burst is consistent with a double-plasma resonance
model in which the radio emission occurs in resonance layers
where the upper-hybrid frequency is harmonically related to the
electron cyclotron frequency in a coronal magnetic loop.},

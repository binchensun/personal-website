abstract: We present the first interferometric observation of a zebra-pattern radio
  burst with simultaneous high spectral (ensuremathâ‰ˆ1 MHz) and high time (20 ms) resolution.
  The Frequency-Agile Solar Radiotelescope Subsystem Testbed (FST) and the Owens Valley
  Solar Array (OVSA) were used in parallel to observe the X1.5 flare on 2006 December
  14. By using OVSA to calibrate the FST, the source position of the zebra pattern
  can be located on the solar disk. With the help of multi-wavelength observations
  and a nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, the zebra source is explored in
  relation to the magnetic field configuration. New constraints are placed on the
  source size and position as a function of frequency and time. We conclude that the
  zebra burst is consistent with a double-plasma resonance model in which the radio
  emission occurs in resonance layers where the upper-hybrid frequency is harmonically
  related to the electron cyclotron frequency in a coronal magnetic loop.

 abstract = {Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are believed to be at the heart of solar
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A well-known example is the
prominence cavity in the low corona that sometimes makes up a
three-part white-light (WL) CME upon its eruption. Such a
system, which is usually observed in quiet-Sun regions, has long
been suggested to be the manifestation of an MFR with relatively
cool filament material collecting near its bottom. However,
observational evidence of eruptive, filament-hosting MFR systems
has been elusive for those originating in active regions. By
utilizing multi-passband extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations
from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we
present direct evidence of an eruptive MFR in the low corona
that exhibits a hot envelope and a cooler core; the latter is
likely the upper part of a filament that undergoes a partial
eruption, which is later observed in the upper corona as the
coiled kernel of a fast, WL CME. This MFR-like structure exists
more than 1 hr prior to its eruption, and displays successive
stages of dynamical evolution, in which both ideal and non-ideal
physical processes may be involved. The timing of the MFR
kinematics is found to be well correlated with the energy
release of the associated long-duration C1.9 flare. We suggest
that the long-duration flare is the result of prolonged energy
release associated with the vertical current sheet induced by
the erupting MFR.},

 abstract = {Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in powering solar flares,
production of energetic particles, and plasma heating. However,
where the magnetic reconnections occur, how and where the
released magnetic energy is transported, and how it is converted
to other forms remain unclear. Here we report recurring
bidirectional plasma outflows located within a large-scale
plasma sheet observed in extreme-ultraviolet emission and
scattered white light during the post-impulsive gradual phase of
the X8.2 solar flare on 2017 September 10. Each of the
bidirectional outflows originates in the plasma sheet from a
discrete site, identified as a magnetic reconnection site. These
reconnection sites reside at very low altitudes ($łt$180 Mm, or
0.26 R$_\ensuremathødot$) above the top of the flare
arcade, a distance only $łt$3% of the total length of a plasma
sheet that extends to at least 10 R$_\ensuremathødot$.
Each arrival of sunward outflows at the loop-top region appears
to coincide with an impulsive microwave and X-ray burst
dominated by a hot source (10-20 MK) at the loop top and a
nonthermal microwave burst located in the loop-leg region. We
propose that the reconnection outflows transport the magnetic
energy released at localized magnetic reconnection sites outward
in the form of kinetic energy flux and/or electromagnetic
Poynting flux. The sunward-directed energy flux induces particle
acceleration and plasma heating in the post-flare arcades,
observed as the hot and nonthermal flare emissions.},

 abstract = {An observation from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph reveals
coherent oscillations in the loops of an M1.6 flare on 2015
March 12. Both the intensity and Doppler shift of Fe xxi 1354.08
̊A show clear oscillations with a period of
~25 s. Remarkably similar oscillations were also
detected in the soft X-ray flux recorded by the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). With an estimated
phase speed of ~2420 km s$^-1$ and a derived
electron density of at least 5.4 × 10$^10$
cm$^-3$, the observed short-period oscillation is most likely
the global fast sausage mode of a hot flare loop. We find a
phase shift of ~\ensuremathπ/2 (1/4
period) between the Doppler shift oscillation and the
intensity/GOES oscillations, which is consistent with a recent
forward modeling study of the sausage mode. The observed
oscillation requires a density contrast between the flare loop
and coronal background of a factor \ensuremath≥42. The
estimated phase speed of the global mode provides a lower limit
of the Alfvén speed outside the flare loop. We also find an
increase of the oscillation period, which might be caused by the
separation of the loop footpoints with time.},

abstract: Observations of the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths offer
  a unique probe into the structure, dynamics, and heating of the chromosphere; the
  structure of sunspots; the formation and eruption of prominences and filaments;
  and energetic phenomena such as jets and flares. High-resolution observations of
  the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are challenging due to the intense,
  extended, low-contrast, and dynamic nature of emission from the quiet Sun, and the
  extremely intense and variable nature of emissions associated with energetic phenomena.
  The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) was designed with solar
  observations in mind. The requirements for solar observations are significantly
  different from observations of sidereal sources and special measures are necessary
  to successfully carry out this type of observations. We describe the commissioning
  efforts that enable the use of two frequency bands, the 3-mm band (Band 3) and the
  1.25-mm band (Band 6), for continuum interferometric-imaging observations of the
  Sun with ALMA. Examples of high-resolution synthesized images obtained using the
  newly commissioned modes during the solar-commissioning campaign held in December
  2015 are presented. Although only 30 of the eventual 66 ALMA antennas were used
  for the campaign, the solar images synthesized from the ALMA commissioning data
  reveal new features of the solar atmosphere that demonstrate the potential power
  of ALMA solar observations. The ongoing expansion of ALMA and solar- commissioning
  efforts will continue to enable new and unique solar observing capabilities.

 abstract = {Observations of the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths
offer a unique probe into the structure, dynamics, and heating
of the chromosphere; the structure of sunspots; the formation
and eruption of prominences and filaments; and energetic
phenomena such as jets and flares. High-resolution observations
of the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are
challenging due to the intense, extended, low-contrast, and
dynamic nature of emission from the quiet Sun, and the extremely
intense and variable nature of emissions associated with
energetic phenomena. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) was designed with solar observations in mind. The
requirements for solar observations are significantly different
from observations of sidereal sources and special measures are
necessary to successfully carry out this type of observations.
We describe the commissioning efforts that enable the use of two
frequency bands, the 3-mm band (Band 3) and the 1.25-mm band
(Band 6), for continuum interferometric-imaging observations of
the Sun with ALMA. Examples of high-resolution synthesized
images obtained using the newly commissioned modes during the
solar-commissioning campaign held in December 2015 are
presented. Although only 30 of the eventual 66 ALMA antennas
were used for the campaign, the solar images synthesized from
the ALMA commissioning data reveal new features of the solar
atmosphere that demonstrate the potential power of ALMA solar
observations. The ongoing expansion of ALMA and solar-
commissioning efforts will continue to enable new and unique
solar observing capabilities.},

abstract: Fiber bursts are a type of fine structure that is often superposed on type
  IV radio continuum emission during solar flares. Although studied for many decades,
  its physical exciter, emission mechanism, and association with the flare energy
  release remain unclear, partly due to the lack of simultaneous imaging observations.
  We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging observations of decimetric fiber
  bursts, which occurred during the rise phase of a long-duration eruptive flare on
  2012 March 3, as obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 1-2 GHz. Our
  results show that the fiber sources are located near and above one footpoint of
  the flare loops. The fiber source and the background continuum source are found
  to be co-spatial and share the same morphology. It is likely that they are associated
  with nonthermal electrons trapped in the converging magnetic fields near the footpoint,
  as supported by a persistent coronal hard X-ray source present during the flare
  rise phase. We analyze three groups of fiber bursts in detail with dynamic imaging
  spectroscopy and obtain their mean frequency-dependent centroid trajectories in
  projection. By using a barometric density model and magnetic field based on a potential
  field extrapolation, we further reconstruct the 3D source trajectories of fiber
  bursts, for comparison with expectations from the whistler wave model and two MHD-based
  models. We conclude that the observed fiber burst properties are consistent with
  an exciter moving at the propagation velocity expected for whistler waves, or models
  that posit similar exciter velocities.

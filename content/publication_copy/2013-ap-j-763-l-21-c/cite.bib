 abstract = {We report observations of type III radio bursts at decimeter wavelengths
(type IIIdm bursts)—signatures of suprathermal
electron beams propagating in the low corona—using
the new technique of radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy provided
by the recently upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. For
the first time, type IIIdm bursts were imaged with high time and
frequency resolution over a broad frequency band, allowing
electron beam trajectories in the corona to be deduced. Together
with simultaneous hard X-ray and extreme ultraviolet
observations, we show that these beams emanate from an energy
release site located in the low corona at a height below
åisebox-0.5ex~15 Mm, and propagate along a
bundle of discrete magnetic loops upward into the corona. Our
observations enable direct measurements of the plasma density
along the magnetic loops, and allow us to constrain the diameter
of these loops to be less than 100 km. These overdense and
ultra-thin loops reveal the fundamentally fibrous structure of
the Sun's corona. The impulsive nature of the electron beams,
their accessibility to different magnetic field lines, and the
detailed structure of the magnetic release site revealed by the
radio observations indicate that the localized energy release is
highly fragmentary in time and space, supporting a bursty
reconnection model that involves secondary magnetic structures
for magnetic energy release and particle acceleration.},

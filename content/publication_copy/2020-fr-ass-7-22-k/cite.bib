 abstract = {Nonthermal electrons accelerated in solar flares produce electromagnetic
emission in two distinct, highly complementary domains---hard
X-rays (HXRs) and microwaves (MWs). This paper reports MW
imaging spectroscopy observations from the Expanded Owens Valley
Solar Array of an M1.2 flare that occurred on 2017 September 9,
from which we deduce evolving coronal parameter maps. We analyze
these data jointly with the complementary Reuven Ramaty High-
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager HXR data to reveal the
spatially-resolved evolution of the nonthermal electrons in the
flaring volume. We find that the high-energy portion of the
nonthermal electron distribution, responsible for the MW
emission, displays a much more prominent evolution (in the form
of strong spectral hardening) than the low-energy portion,
responsible for the HXR emission. We show that the revealed
trends are consistent with a single electron population evolving
according to a simplified trap-plus-precipitation model with
sustained injection/acceleration of nonthermal electrons, which
produces a double-powerlaw with steadily increasing break
energy.},

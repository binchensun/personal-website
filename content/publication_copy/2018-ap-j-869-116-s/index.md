abstract: In eruptive solar flares, termination shocks (TSs), formed when high- speed
  reconnection outflows collide with closed dense flaring loops, are believed to be
  one of the possible candidates for plasma heating and particle acceleration. In
  this work, we perform resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations in a classic Kopp-Pneuman
  flare configuration to study the formation and evolution of TSs, and we analyze
  in detail the dynamic features of TSs and variations of the shock strength in space
  and time. This research focuses on the fast-reconnection phase when plasmoids form
  and produce small-scale structures inside the flare current sheet. It is found that
  the TS emerges once the downward outflow colliding with closed magnetic loops becomes
  supermagnetosonic and immediately becomes highly dynamical. The morphology of a
  TS can be flat, oblique, or curved depending on the detailed interactions between
  the outflows/plasmoids and the highly dynamic plasma in the loop-top region. The
  TS becomes weaker when a plasmoid is crossing through, or may even be destroyed
  by well-developed plasmoids and then reconstructed above the plasmoids. We also
  perform detailed statistical analysis on important physical quantities along and
  across the shock front. The density and temperature ratios range from 1 to 3 across
  the TS front, and the pressure ratio typically has larger values up to 10. We show
  that weak guide fields do not strongly affect the Mach number and compression ratios,
  and the TS length becomes slightly larger in the case with thermal conduction.

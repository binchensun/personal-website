abstract: Coronal hard X-ray (HXR) and continuum ensuremathγ-ray sources associated
  with the impulsive phase of solar flares have been the subject of renewed interest
  in recent years. They have been interpreted in terms of thin-target, non-thermal
  bremsstrahlung emission. This interpretation has led to rather extreme physical
  requirements in some cases. For example, in one case, essentially all of the electrons
  in the source must be accelerated to non-thermal energies to account for the coronal
  HXR source. In other cases, the extremely hard photon spectra of the coronal continuum
  ensuremathγ-ray emission suggest that the low-energy cutoff of the electron energy
  distribution lies in the MeV energy range. Here, we consider the role of inverse
  Compton scattering (ICS) as an alternate emission mechanism in both the ultra- and
  mildly relativistic regimes. It is known that relativistic electrons are produced
  during powerful flares; these are capable of upscattering soft photospheric photons
  to HXR and ensuremathγ-ray energies. Previously overlooked is the fact that mildly
  relativistic electrons, generally produced in much greater numbers in flares of
  all sizes, can upscatter extreme- ultraviolet/soft X-ray photons to HXR energies.
  We also explore ICS on anisotropic electron distributions and show that the resulting
  emission can be significantly enhanced over an isotropic electron distribution for
  favorable viewing geometries. We briefly review results from bremsstrahlung emission
  and reconsider circumstances under which non-thermal bremsstrahlung or ICS would
  be favored. Finally, we consider a selection of coronal HXR and ensuremathγ-ray
  events and find that in some cases the ICS is a viable alternative emission mechanism.

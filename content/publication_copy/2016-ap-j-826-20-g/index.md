abstract: We present results from the the first campaign of dedicated solar observations
  undertaken by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) hard X-ray (HXR)
  telescope. Designed as an astrophysics mission, NuSTAR nonetheless has the capability
  of directly imaging the Sun at HXR energies ($gt$3 keV) with an increase in sensitivity
  of at least two magnitude compared to current non-focusing telescopes. In this paper
  we describe the scientific areas where NuSTAR will make major improvements on existing
  solar measurements. We report on the techniques used to observe the Sun with NuSTAR,
  their limitations and complications, and the procedures developed to optimize solar
  data quality derived from our experience with the initial solar observations. These
  first observations are briefly described, including the measurement of the Fe K-shell
  lines in a decaying X-class flare, HXR emission from high in the solar corona, and
  full-disk HXR images of the Sun.

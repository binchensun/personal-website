abstract: We report microwave spectral imaging observations of an erupting magnetic
  flux rope during the early impulsive phase of the X8.2-class limb flare on 2017
  September 10, obtained by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. A few days prior
  to the eruption, when viewed against the disk, the flux rope appeared as a reverse
  S-shaped dark filament along the magnetic polarity inversion line. During the eruption,
  the rope exhibited a ``hot channel'' structure in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray
  passbands sensitive to ~10 MK plasma. The central portion of the flux rope was nearly
  aligned with the line of sight, which quickly developed into a teardrop-shaped dark
  cavity during the early phase of the eruption. A long and thin plasma sheet formed
  below the cavity, interpreted as the reconnection current sheet viewed edge on.
  A nonthermal microwave source was present at the location of the central current
  sheet, which extended upward encompassing the dark cavity. A pair of nonthermal
  microwave sources were observed for several minutes on both sides of the main flaring
  region. They shared a similar temporal behavior and spectral property to the central
  microwave source below the cavity, interpreted as the conjugate footpoints of the
  erupting flux rope. These observations are broadly consistent with the magnetic
  topology and the associated energy release scenario suggested in the three-dimensional
  standard model for eruptive solar flares. In particular, our detection of nonthermal
  emission at conjugate flux rope footpoints provides solid evidence of particle transport
  along an erupting magnetic flux rope.

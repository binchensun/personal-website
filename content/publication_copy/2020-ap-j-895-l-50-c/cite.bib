 abstract = {We report microwave spectral imaging observations of an erupting
magnetic flux rope during the early impulsive phase of the
X8.2-class limb flare on 2017 September 10, obtained by the
Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. A few days prior to the
eruption, when viewed against the disk, the flux rope appeared
as a reverse S-shaped dark filament along the magnetic polarity
inversion line. During the eruption, the rope exhibited a ``hot
channel'' structure in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray
passbands sensitive to ~10 MK plasma. The
central portion of the flux rope was nearly aligned with the
line of sight, which quickly developed into a teardrop-shaped
dark cavity during the early phase of the eruption. A long and
thin plasma sheet formed below the cavity, interpreted as the
reconnection current sheet viewed edge on. A nonthermal
microwave source was present at the location of the central
current sheet, which extended upward encompassing the dark
cavity. A pair of nonthermal microwave sources were observed for
several minutes on both sides of the main flaring region. They
shared a similar temporal behavior and spectral property to the
central microwave source below the cavity, interpreted as the
conjugate footpoints of the erupting flux rope. These
observations are broadly consistent with the magnetic topology
and the associated energy release scenario suggested in the
three-dimensional standard model for eruptive solar flares. In
particular, our detection of nonthermal emission at conjugate
flux rope footpoints provides solid evidence of particle
transport along an erupting magnetic flux rope.},

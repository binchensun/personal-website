abstract: In this study, we investigate motions in the hot plasma above the flare
  loops during the 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare event. We examine the region to the
  south of the main flare arcade, where there is data from the Interface Region Imaging
  Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode.
  We find that there are initial blueshifts of 20-60 km s$^-1$ observed in this region
  in the Fe XXI line in IRIS and the Fe XXIV line in EIS, and that the locations of
  these blueshifts move southward along the arcade over the course of about 10 minutes.
  The cadence of IRIS allows us to follow the evolution of these flows, and we find
  that at each location where there is an initial blueshift in the Fe XXI line, there
  are damped oscillations in the Doppler velocity with periods of ~400 s. We conclude
  that these periods are independent of loop length, ruling out magnetoacoustic standing
  modes as a possible mechanism. Microwave observations from the Expanded Owens Valley
  Solar Array (EOVSA) indicate that there are nonthermal emissions in the region where
  the Doppler shifts are observed, indicating that accelerated particles are present.
  We suggest that the flows and oscillations are due to motions of the magnetic field
  that are caused by reconnection outflows disturbing the loop-top region.

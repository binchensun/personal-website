 abstract = {Solar flares involve the sudden release of magnetic energy in the solar
corona. Accelerated nonthermal electrons have often been invoked
as the primary means for transporting the bulk of the released
energy to the lower solar atmosphere. However, significant
challenges remain for this scenario, especially in accounting
for the large number of accelerated electrons inferred from
observations. Propagating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves,
particularly those with subsecond/second-scale periods, have
been proposed as an alternative means for transporting the
released flare energy, likely alongside the electron beams,
while observational evidence remains elusive. Here we report a
possible detection of such waves in the late impulsive phase of
a two-ribbon flare. This is based on ultrahigh cadence dynamic
imaging spectroscopic observations of a peculiar type of
decimetric radio bursts obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array. Radio imaging at each time and frequency pixel
allows us to trace the spatiotemporal motion of the source,
which agrees with the implications of the frequency drift
pattern in the dynamic spectrum. The radio source, propagating
at 1000-2000 km s$^-1$ in projection, shows close spatial and
temporal association with transient brightenings on the flare
ribbon. In addition, multitudes of subsecond-period oscillations
are present in the radio emission. We interpret the observed
radio bursts as short-period MHD wave packets propagating along
newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes linking to the flare
ribbon. The estimated energy flux carried by the waves is
comparable to that needed to account for the plasma heating
during the late impulsive phase of this flare.},

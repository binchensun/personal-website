abstract: Magnetic reconnection, the central engine that powers explosive phenomena
  throughout the universe, is also perceived to be one of the principal mechanisms
  for accelerating particles to high energies. Although various signatures of magnetic
  reconnection have been frequently reported, observational evidence that links particle
  acceleration directly to the reconnection site has been rare, especially for space
  plasma environments currently inaccessible to in situ measurements. Here we utilize
  broadband radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy available from the Karl G. Jansky Very
  Large Array to observe decimetric type III radio bursts in a solar jet with high
  angular (~20″), spectral (~1%), and temporal resolution (50 ms). These observations
  allow us to derive detailed trajectories of semirelativistic (tens of keV) electron
  beams in the low solar corona with unprecedentedly high angular precision ($łt$0.″65).
  We found that each group of electron beams, which corresponds to a cluster of type
  III bursts with 1-2 s duration, diverges from an extremely compact region (~600
  km$^2$) in the low solar corona. The beam-diverging sites are located behind the
  erupting jet spire and above the closed arcades, coinciding with the presumed location
  of magnetic reconnection in the jet eruption picture supported by extreme ultraviolet/X-ray
  data and magnetic modeling. We interpret each beam-diverging site as a reconnection
  null point where multitudes of magnetic flux tubes join and reconnect. Our data
  suggest that the null points likely consist of a high level of density inhomogeneities
  possibly down to 10 km scales. These results, at least in the present case, strongly
  favor a reconnection-driven electron-acceleration scenario.

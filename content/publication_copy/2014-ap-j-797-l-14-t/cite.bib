 abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant energy release
mechanism in solar flares. The standard flare model predicts
both downward and upward outflow plasmas with speeds close to
the coronal Alfvén speed. Yet, spectroscopic observations of
such outflows, especially the downflows, are extremely rare.
With observations of the newly launched Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS), we report the detection of a greatly
redshifted (åisebox-0.5ex~125 km s$^-1$
along the line of sight) Fe XXI 1354.08 \Å emission line
with a \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~100 km s$^-1$
nonthermal width at the reconnection site of a flare. The
redshifted Fe XXI feature coincides spatially with the loop-top
X-ray source observed by RHESSI. We interpret this large
redshift as the signature of downward-moving reconnection
outflow/hot retracting loops. Imaging observations from both
IRIS and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory also reveal the eruption and
reconnection processes. Fast downward-propagating blobs along
these loops are also found from cool emission lines (e.g., Si
IV, O IV, C II, Mg II) and images of AIA and IRIS. Furthermore,
the entire Fe XXI line is blueshifted by
\rae̊box-0.5ex~260 km s$^-1$ at the loop
footpoints, where the cool lines mentioned above all exhibit
obvious redshift, a result that is consistent with the scenario
of chromospheric evaporation induced by downward-propagating
nonthermal electrons from the reconnection site.},

 abstract = {We report the first science results from the newly completed Expanded
Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), which obtained excellent
microwave (MW) imaging spectroscopy observations of
SOL2017-09-10, a classic partially occulted solar limb flare
associated with an erupting flux rope. This event is also well-
covered by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI) in hard X-rays (HXRs). We present an overview of
this event focusing on MW and HXR data, both associated with
high-energy nonthermal electrons, and we discuss them within the
context of the flare geometry and evolution revealed by extreme
ultraviolet observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The EOVSA and
RHESSI data reveal the evolving spatial and energy distribution
of high-energy electrons throughout the entire flaring region.
The results suggest that the MW and HXR sources largely arise
from a common nonthermal electron population, although the MW
imaging spectroscopy provides information over a much larger
volume of the corona.},

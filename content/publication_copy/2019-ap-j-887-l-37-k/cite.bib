 abstract = {Nonthermal loop-top sources in solar flares are the most prominent
observational signatures that suggest energy release and
particle acceleration in the solar corona. Although several
scenarios for particle acceleration have been proposed, the
origin of the loop-top sources remains unclear. Here we present
a model that combines a large-scale magnetohydrodynamic
simulation of a two-ribbon flare with a particle acceleration
and transport model for investigating electron acceleration by a
fast-mode termination shock (TS) at the loop top. Our model
provides spatially resolved electron distribution that evolves
in response to the dynamic flare geometry. We find a concave-
downward magnetic structure located below the flare TS, induced
by the fast reconnection downflows. It acts as a magnetic trap
to confine the electrons at the loop top for an extended period
of time. The electrons are energized significantly as they cross
the shock front, and eventually build up a power-law energy
spectrum extending to hundreds of kiloelectron volts. We suggest
that this particle acceleration and transport scenario driven by
a flare TS is a viable interpretation for the observed
nonthermal loop-top sources.},

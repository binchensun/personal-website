 abstract = {We report the detection of emission from a nonthermal electron
distribution in a small solar microflare (GOES class A5.7)
observed by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, with
supporting observation by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The flaring plasma is well
accounted for by a thick-target model of accelerated electrons
collisionally thermalizing within the loop, akin to the
``coronal thick-target'' behavior occasionally observed in
larger flares. This is the first positive detection of
nonthermal hard X-rays from the Sun using a direct imager (as
opposed to indirectly imaging instruments). The accelerated
electron distribution has a spectral index of 6.3
\ensuremath± 0.7, extends down to at least 6.5 keV, and
deposits energy at a rate of \ensuremath∼2 ×
10$^27$ erg s$^-1$, heating the flare loop to at least 10
MK. The existence of dominant nonthermal emission in X-rays down
to $łt$5 keV means that RHESSI emission is almost entirely
nonthermal, contrary to what is usually assumed in RHESSI
spectroscopy. The ratio of nonthermal to thermal energies is
similar to that of large flares, in contrast to what has been
found in previous studies of small RHESSI flares. We suggest
that a coronal thick target may be a common property of many
small microflares based on the average electron energy and
collisional mean free path. Future observations of this kind
will enable understanding of how flare particle acceleration
changes across energy scales, and will aid the push toward the
observational regime of nanoflares, which are a possible source
of significant coronal heating.},

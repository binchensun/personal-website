abstract: The energy conversion rate in Petschek-type reconnection is modeled by parameterizing
  it with the reconnection rate and a dimensionless factor associated with the structure
  across the reconnection exhaust. We determine this factor by solving for the magnetic
  field and density change over the magnetohydrodynamic transitions, which bound the
  outflow exhaust. With a stronger guide field and/or lower plasma β, the
  fraction of the reconnecting magnetic field energy, which is transferred into the
  plasma, can decrease, but is lower-bounded by half of the reconnecting magnetic
  field energy. The prediction agrees reasonably well with the results in particle-
  in-cell simulations. We discuss implications to our understanding of energy transfer
  in reconnection and applications for finding the energy conversion rate in solar
  flares.

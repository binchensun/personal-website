 abstract = {An uncommon fine structure in the radio spectrum consisting of bursts in
absorption was observed with the Chinese Solar Broadband
Radiospectrometer (SBRS) in the frequency range of 2.6 - 3.8 GHz
during an X3.4/4B flare on 13 December 2006 in active region
NOAA 10930 (S05W33). Usual fine structures in emission such as
spikes, zebra stripes, and drifting fibers were observed at the
peak of every new flare brightening. Within an hour at the decay
phase of the event we observed bursts consisting of spikes in
absorption, which pulsated periodically in frequency. Their
instantaneous frequency bandwidths were found to be in the 75
MHz range. Moreover, in the strongest Type III-like bursts in
absorption, the spikes showed stripes of the zebra-pattern (ZP)
that drifted to higher frequencies. All spikes had the duration
as short as down to the limit of the instrument resolution of
\ensuremath≈8 ms. The TRACE 195 ̊A images
indicate that the magnetic reconnection at this moment occurred
in the western edge of the flare loop arcade. Taking into
account the presence of the reverse-drifting bursts in emission,
in the course of the restoration of the magnetic structures in
the corona, the acceleration of the beams of fast particles must
have occurred both upward and downward at different heights. The
upward beams will be captured by the magnetic trap, where the
loss-cone distribution of fast particles (responsible for the
emission of continuum and ZP) were formed. An additional
injection of fast particles will fill the loss-cone later,
breaking the loss-cone distribution. Therefore, the generation
of continuum will be quenched at these moments, which was
evidenced by the formation of bursts in absorption.},

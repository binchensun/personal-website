abstract: An uncommon fine structure in the radio spectrum consisting of bursts in
  absorption was observed with the Chinese Solar Broadband Radiospectrometer (SBRS)
  in the frequency range of 2.6 - 3.8 GHz during an X3.4/4B flare on 13 December 2006
  in active region NOAA 10930 (S05W33). Usual fine structures in emission such as
  spikes, zebra stripes, and drifting fibers were observed at the peak of every new
  flare brightening. Within an hour at the decay phase of the event we observed bursts
  consisting of spikes in absorption, which pulsated periodically in frequency. Their
  instantaneous frequency bandwidths were found to be in the 75 MHz range. Moreover,
  in the strongest Type III-like bursts in absorption, the spikes showed stripes of
  the zebra-pattern (ZP) that drifted to higher frequencies. All spikes had the duration
  as short as down to the limit of the instrument resolution of ensuremath≈8 ms. The
  TRACE 195 ̊A images indicate that the magnetic reconnection at this moment occurred
  in the western edge of the flare loop arcade. Taking into account the presence of
  the reverse-drifting bursts in emission, in the course of the restoration of the
  magnetic structures in the corona, the acceleration of the beams of fast particles
  must have occurred both upward and downward at different heights. The upward beams
  will be captured by the magnetic trap, where the loss-cone distribution of fast
  particles (responsible for the emission of continuum and ZP) were formed. An additional
  injection of fast particles will fill the loss-cone later, breaking the loss-cone
  distribution. Therefore, the generation of continuum will be quenched at these moments,
  which was evidenced by the formation of bursts in absorption.

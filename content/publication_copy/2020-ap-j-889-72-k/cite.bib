 abstract = {Drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) are important radio fine structures
usually observed at the beginning of eruptive solar flares. It
has been suggested that DPSs carry important information on the
energy release processes in solar flares. We study DPS observed
in an X8.2-class flare on 2017 September 10 in the context of
spatial and spectral diagnostics provided by microwave, EUV, and
X-ray observations. We describe DPS and its substructures that
were observed for the first time. We use a new wavelet technique
to reveal characteristic periods in DPS and their frequency
bands. Comparing the periods of pulsations found in this DPS
with those in previous DPSs, we found new very short periods in
the 0.09-0.15 s range. We present Expanded Owens Valley Solar
Array images and spectra of microwave sources observed during
the DPS. This DPS at its very beginning has pulsations in two
frequency bands (1000-1300 MHz and 1600-1800 MHz), which are
interconnected by fast drifting bursts. We show that these
double-band pulsations started just at the moment when the
ejected filament splits apart in a tearing motion at the
location where a signature of the flare current sheet later
appeared. Using the standard flare model and previous
observations of DPSs, we interpret these double-band pulsations
as a radio signature of superthermal electrons trapped in the
rising magnetic rope and flare arcade at the moment when the
flare magnetic reconnection starts. The results are discussed in
a scenario with the plasmoid in the rising magnetic rope.},

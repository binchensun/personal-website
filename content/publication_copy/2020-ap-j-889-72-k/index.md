abstract: Drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) are important radio fine structures
  usually observed at the beginning of eruptive solar flares. It has been suggested
  that DPSs carry important information on the energy release processes in solar flares.
  We study DPS observed in an X8.2-class flare on 2017 September 10 in the context
  of spatial and spectral diagnostics provided by microwave, EUV, and X-ray observations.
  We describe DPS and its substructures that were observed for the first time. We
  use a new wavelet technique to reveal characteristic periods in DPS and their frequency
  bands. Comparing the periods of pulsations found in this DPS with those in previous
  DPSs, we found new very short periods in the 0.09-0.15 s range. We present Expanded
  Owens Valley Solar Array images and spectra of microwave sources observed during
  the DPS. This DPS at its very beginning has pulsations in two frequency bands (1000-1300
  MHz and 1600-1800 MHz), which are interconnected by fast drifting bursts. We show
  that these double-band pulsations started just at the moment when the ejected filament
  splits apart in a tearing motion at the location where a signature of the flare
  current sheet later appeared. Using the standard flare model and previous observations
  of DPSs, we interpret these double-band pulsations as a radio signature of superthermal
  electrons trapped in the rising magnetic rope and flare arcade at the moment when
  the flare magnetic reconnection starts. The results are discussed in a scenario
  with the plasmoid in the rising magnetic rope.

 abstract = {As one of the most spectacular energy release events in the solar
system, solar flares are generally powered by magnetic
reconnection in the solar corona. As a result of the re-
arrangement of magnetic field topology after the reconnection
process, a series of new loop-like magnetic structures are often
formed and are known as flare loops. A hot diffuse region,
consisting of around 5-10 MK plasma, is also observed above the
loops and is called a supra-arcade fan. Often, dark, tadpole-
like structures are seen to descend through the bright supra-
arcade fans. It remains unclear what role these so-called supra-
arcade downflows (SADs) play in heating the flaring coronal
plasma. Here we show a unique flare observation, where many SADs
collide with the flare loops and strongly heat the loops to a
temperature of 10-20 MK. Several of these interactions generate
clear signatures of quasi-periodic enhancement in the full-Sun-
integrated soft X-ray emission, providing an alternative
interpretation for quasi-periodic pulsations that are commonly
observed during solar and stellar flares.},

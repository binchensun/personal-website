abstract: Solar flare termination shocks have been suggested as one of the promising
  drivers for particle acceleration in solar flares, yet observational evidence remains
  rare. By utilizing radio dynamic spectroscopic imaging of decimetric stochastic
  spike bursts in an eruptive flare, Chen et al. found that the bursts form a dynamic
  surface-like feature located at the ending points of fast plasma downflows above
  the looptop, interpreted as a flare termination shock. One piece of observational
  evidence that strongly supports the termination shock interpretation is the occasional
  split of the emission band into two finer lanes in frequency, similar to the split-band
  feature seen in fast- coronal-shock-driven type II radio bursts. Here, we perform
  spatially, spectrally, and temporally resolved analysis of the split-band feature
  of the flare termination shock event. We find that the ensemble of the radio centroids
  from the two split-band lanes each outlines a nearly co-spatial surface. The high-
  frequency lane is located slightly below its low-frequency counterpart by ~0.8 Mm,
  which strongly supports the shock-upstream-downstream interpretation. Under this
  scenario, the density compression ratio across the shock front can be inferred from
  the frequency split, which implies a shock with a Mach number of up to 2.0. Further,
  the spatiotemporal evolution of the density compression along the shock front agrees
  favorably with results from magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We conclude that the
  detailed variations of the shock compression ratio may be due to the impact of dynamic
  plasma structures in the reconnection outflows, which results in distortion of the
  shock front.

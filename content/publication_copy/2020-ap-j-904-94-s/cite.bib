 abstract = {Solar flares are sudden energy release events in the solar corona,
resulting from magnetic reconnection, that accelerate particles
and heat the ambient plasma. During a flare, there are often
multiple temporally and spatially separated individual energy
release episodes that can be difficult to resolve depending on
the observing instrument. We present multiwavelength imaging and
spectroscopy observations of multiple electron acceleration
episodes during a GOES B1.7-class two-ribbon flare on 2012
February 25, observed simultaneously with the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array at 1-2 GHz, the Reuven Ramatay High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager in X-rays, and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory in extreme ultraviolet. During the initial phase of
the flare, five radio bursts were observed. A nonthermal X-ray
source was seen to be cotemporal but not cospatial with the
first three radio bursts. Their radio spectra are interpreted as
optically thick gyrosynchrotron emission. By fitting the radio
spectra with a gyrosynchrotron model, we derive the magnetic
field strength and nonthermal electron spectral parameters in
each acceleration episode. Notably, the nonthermal parameters
derived from X-rays differ considerably from the nonthermal
parameters inferred from the radio. The observations are
indicative of multiple cotemporal acceleration episodes during
the impulsive phase of a solar microflare. The X-ray and radio
burst sources likely originate from separate electron
distributions in different magnetic loops.},

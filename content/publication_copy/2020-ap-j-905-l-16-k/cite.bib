 abstract = {A fast-mode shock can form in the front of reconnection outflows and has
been suggested as a promising site for particle acceleration in
solar flares. Recent developments in the study of magnetic
reconnection have shown that numerous plasmoids can be produced
in a large-scale current layer. Here we investigate the
dynamical modulation of electron acceleration in the looptop
region when plasmoids intermittently arrive at the shock by
combining magnetohydrodynamics simulations with a particle
kinetic model. As plasmoids interact with the shock, the looptop
region exhibits various compressible structures that modulate
the production of energetic electrons. The energetic electron
population varies rapidly in both time and space. The number of
5-10 keV electrons correlates well with the compression area,
while that of $\gt$50 keV electrons shows good correlation with
the strong compression area but only moderate correlation with
shock parameters. We further examine the impacts of the first
plasmoid, which marks the transition from a quasi-steady shock
front to a distorted and dynamical shock. The number of
energetic electrons is reduced by ~20% at 15-25
keV and nearly 40% for 25-50 keV, while the number of 5-10 keV
electrons increases. In addition, the electron energy spectrum
above 10 keV evolves softer with time. We also find that double
or even multiple distinct sources can develop in the looptop
region when the plasmoids move across the shock. Our simulations
have strong implications to the interpretation of nonthermal
looptop sources, as well as the commonly observed fast temporal
variations in flare emissions, including the quasi-periodic
pulsations.},

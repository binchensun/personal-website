abstract: A fast-mode shock can form in the front of reconnection outflows and has
  been suggested as a promising site for particle acceleration in solar flares. Recent
  developments in the study of magnetic reconnection have shown that numerous plasmoids
  can be produced in a large-scale current layer. Here we investigate the dynamical
  modulation of electron acceleration in the looptop region when plasmoids intermittently
  arrive at the shock by combining magnetohydrodynamics simulations with a particle
  kinetic model. As plasmoids interact with the shock, the looptop region exhibits
  various compressible structures that modulate the production of energetic electrons.
  The energetic electron population varies rapidly in both time and space. The number
  of 5-10 keV electrons correlates well with the compression area, while that of $gt$50
  keV electrons shows good correlation with the strong compression area but only moderate
  correlation with shock parameters. We further examine the impacts of the first plasmoid,
  which marks the transition from a quasi-steady shock front to a distorted and dynamical
  shock. The number of energetic electrons is reduced by ~20% at 15-25 keV and nearly
  40% for 25-50 keV, while the number of 5-10 keV electrons increases. In addition,
  the electron energy spectrum above 10 keV evolves softer with time. We also find
  that double or even multiple distinct sources can develop in the looptop region
  when the plasmoids move across the shock. Our simulations have strong implications
  to the interpretation of nonthermal looptop sources, as well as the commonly observed
  fast temporal variations in flare emissions, including the quasi-periodic pulsations.

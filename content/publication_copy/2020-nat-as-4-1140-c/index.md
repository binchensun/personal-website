abstract: In the standard model of solar flares, a large-scale reconnection current
  sheet is postulated to be the central engine for powering the flare energy release$^1-3$
  and accelerating particles$^4-6$. However, where and how the energy release and
  particle acceleration occur remain unclear owing to the lack of measurements of
  the magnetic properties of the current sheet. Here we report the measurement of
  the spatially resolved magnetic field and flare-accelerated relativistic electrons
  along a current-sheet feature in a solar flare. The measured magnetic field profile
  shows a local maximum where the reconnecting field lines of opposite polarities
  closely approach each other, known as the reconnection X point. The measurements
  also reveal a local minimum near the bottom of the current sheet above the flare
  loop-top, referred to as a `magnetic bottle'. This spatial structure agrees with
  theoretical predictions$^1,7$ and numerical modelling results. A strong reconnection
  electric field of about 4,000 V m$^-1$ is inferred near the X point. This location,
  however, shows a local depletion of microwave-emitting relativistic electrons. These
  electrons instead concentrate at or near the magnetic bottle structure, where more
  than 99% of them reside at each instant. Our observations suggest that the loop-top
  magnetic bottle is probably the primary site for accelerating and confining the
  relativistic electrons.

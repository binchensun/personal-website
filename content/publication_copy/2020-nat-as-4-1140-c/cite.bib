 abstract = {In the standard model of solar flares, a large-scale reconnection
current sheet is postulated to be the central engine for
powering the flare energy release$^1-3$ and accelerating
particles$^4-6$. However, where and how the energy release and
particle acceleration occur remain unclear owing to the lack of
measurements of the magnetic properties of the current sheet.
Here we report the measurement of the spatially resolved
magnetic field and flare-accelerated relativistic electrons
along a current-sheet feature in a solar flare. The measured
magnetic field profile shows a local maximum where the
reconnecting field lines of opposite polarities closely approach
each other, known as the reconnection X point. The measurements
also reveal a local minimum near the bottom of the current sheet
above the flare loop-top, referred to as a `magnetic bottle'.
This spatial structure agrees with theoretical
predictions$^1,7$ and numerical modelling results. A strong
reconnection electric field of about 4,000 V m$^-1$ is
inferred near the X point. This location, however, shows a local
depletion of microwave-emitting relativistic electrons. These
electrons instead concentrate at or near the magnetic bottle
structure, where more than 99% of them reside at each instant.
Our observations suggest that the loop-top magnetic bottle is
probably the primary site for accelerating and confining the
relativistic electrons.},

abstract: The first self-consistent simulations of electron acceleration during magnetic
  reconnection in a macroscale system are presented. Consistent with solar flare observations,
  the spectra of energetic electrons take the form of power laws that extend more
  than two decades in energy. The drive mechanism for these nonthermal electrons is
  Fermi reflection in growing and merging magnetic flux ropes. A strong guide field
  suppresses the production of nonthermal electrons by weakening the Fermi drive mechanism.
  For a weak guide field the total energy content of nonthermal electrons dominates
  that of the hot thermal electrons even though their number density remains small.
  Our results are benchmarked with the hard x-ray, radio, and extreme ultraviolet
  observations of the X8.2-class solar flare on September 10, 2017.

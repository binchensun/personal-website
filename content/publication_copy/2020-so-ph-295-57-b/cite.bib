 abstract = {The SunPy Project developed a 13-question survey to understand the
software and hardware usage of the solar-physics community. Of
the solar-physics community, 364 members across 35 countries
responded to our survey. We found that 99 \ensuremath±0.5
% of respondents use software in their research and 66% use
the Python scientific-software stack. Students are twice as
likely as faculty, staff scientists, and researchers to use
Python rather than Interactive Data Language (IDL). In this
respect, the astrophysics and solar-physics communities differ
widely: 78% of solar-physics faculty, staff scientists, and
researchers in our sample uses IDL, compared with 44% of
astrophysics faculty and scientists sampled by Momcheva and
Tollerud (2015). 63 \ensuremath±4 % of respondents have
not taken any computer-science courses at an undergraduate or
graduate level. We also found that most respondents use consumer
hardware to run software for solar-physics research. Although
82% of respondents work with data from space-based or ground-
based missions, some of which (e.g. the Solar Dynamics
Observatory and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope) produce
terabytes of data a day, 14% use a regional or national
cluster, 5% use a commercial cloud provider, and 29% use
exclusively a laptop or desktop. Finally, we found that 73
\ensuremath±4 % of respondents cite scientific software
in their research, although only 42 \ensuremath±3 % do so
routinely.},

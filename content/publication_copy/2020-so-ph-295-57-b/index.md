abstract: 'The SunPy Project developed a 13-question survey to understand the software
  and hardware usage of the solar-physics community. Of the solar-physics community,
  364 members across 35 countries responded to our survey. We found that 99 ensuremath±0.5
  % of respondents use software in their research and 66% use the Python scientific-software
  stack. Students are twice as likely as faculty, staff scientists, and researchers
  to use Python rather than Interactive Data Language (IDL). In this respect, the
  astrophysics and solar-physics communities differ widely: 78% of solar-physics faculty,
  staff scientists, and researchers in our sample uses IDL, compared with 44% of astrophysics
  faculty and scientists sampled by Momcheva and Tollerud (2015). 63 ensuremath±4
  % of respondents have not taken any computer-science courses at an undergraduate
  or graduate level. We also found that most respondents use consumer hardware to
  run software for solar-physics research. Although 82% of respondents work with data
  from space-based or ground- based missions, some of which (e.g. the Solar Dynamics
  Observatory and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope) produce terabytes of data a day,
  14% use a regional or national cluster, 5% use a commercial cloud provider, and
  29% use exclusively a laptop or desktop. Finally, we found that 73 ensuremath±4
  % of respondents cite scientific software in their research, although only 42 ensuremath±3
  % do so routinely.'

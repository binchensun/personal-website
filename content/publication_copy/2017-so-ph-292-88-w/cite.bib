 abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope
has commenced science observations of the Sun starting in late
2016. Since the Sun is much larger than the field of view of
individual ALMA dishes, the ALMA interferometer is unable to
measure the background level of solar emission when observing
the solar disk. The absolute temperature scale is a critical
measurement for much of ALMA solar science, including the
understanding of energy transfer through the solar atmosphere,
the properties of prominences, and the study of shock heating in
the chromosphere. In order to provide an absolute temperature
scale, ALMA solar observing will take advantage of the
remarkable fast-scanning capabilities of the ALMA 12 m dishes to
make single-dish maps of the full Sun. This article reports on
the results of an extensive commissioning effort to optimize the
mapping procedure, and it describes the nature of the resulting
data. Amplitude calibration is discussed in detail: a path that
uses the two loads in the ALMA calibration system as well as sky
measurements is described and applied to commissioning data.
Inspection of a large number of single-dish datasets shows
significant variation in the resulting temperatures, and based
on the temperature distributions, we derive quiet-Sun values at
disk center of 7300 K at \ensuremathłambda = 3 mm and 5900
K at \ensuremathłambda = 1.3 mm. These values have
statistical uncertainties of about 100 K, but systematic
uncertainties in the temperature scale that may be significantly
larger. Example images are presented from two periods with very
different levels of solar activity. At a resolution of about
25'', the 1.3 mm wavelength images show temperatures on the disk
that vary over about a 2000 K range. Active regions and plages
are among the hotter features, while a large sunspot umbra shows
up as a depression, and filament channels are relatively cool.
Prominences above the solar limb are a common feature of the
single-dish images.},
